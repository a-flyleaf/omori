    - alt: A very bashful Basil asks Aubrey, “How would I say—‘Sunny, you’re my entire world! I love you so much!’ Aubrey stares at him, then answers. Basil recognizes a word, and not for the better; Aubrey bonks him on the head, muttering.”

      <sup>[1]</sup> <span lang="hr">"Da"</span> usually means "yes," but in this *specific* context it also means "that": If it's used in an independent clause (e.g. "Sorry <u>that I attacked</u> your eye"), then <span lang="hr">"da"</span> as "that" checks out; unlike in English, the "<span lang="hr">da</span>/that" isn't dropped. Otherwise ("Sorry <u>for attacking</u> your eye"), no dice.
      
      <sup>[2]</sup> This bit gave me issues; the original thought was "I have problems," and after I ran around in a small circle trying to pinpoint a more specific word for "problems," Weeb nudged me back to a 1:1 translation. (Alternatives: "I have issues," "I am dysfunctional/mentally&nbsp;ill," "I am unwell." General sentiment of "I'm fucked&nbsp;up [but not phrased in an overly clinical or serious way]." "There's something wrong with me" sounded a bit harsh in English but ¯\\\_(&nbsp;:V&nbsp;)_/¯, I do not have enough cultural context for a better phrasing!)

    - alt: Wall of every scribble thus far, shoehorned into something resembling a chronology.
    an: |-
      Since this is basically <span lang="hr" class="noi">jezik</span> pingpong, here's the whole thing in one go:
      - "<s class="ne">Ya like lore?</s> <span lang="hr">Uživaš li priča?</span>" [attempted "Do you enjoy story?"]
        - "Lore," being more of a Meme Word in this context, could've been used untranslated.
        - <q lang="hr">Uživati</q> ("to enjoy") is also a weird verb, so this is also wrong on a few other levels I don't *quite* grok yet.
      - <span lang="hr">Početak</span>. [Beginning.]
      - 1.&nbsp;Aubrey inexplicably <span lang="hr">hrvat</span> [a Croat], <span lang="hr">učio</span> [teaches] Basil (some) <span lang="hr">hrvatski</span> [Croatian]...
        - Bit fluky for reasons I didn't fully understand at the time; should be <q lang="hr">hrvatica</q> (Croatian person, but female; distinction is necessary here, unlike English), <q lang="hr">učila je</q> (she taught), wrong grammatical case....\*
      - 2.&nbsp;others <span lang="hr">nisu znaju</span> [don't know] shit tho (otherwise canon as normal)
        - *Also* wrong, for Reasons.\*
      - 3.&nbsp;Shit Happens.
      - <span lang="hr">Crni Prostor <span lang="en">ft.</span> Riječ... Zbu[n]jenog?</span> [Black Space ft. Words of... Confusion?]
        - error conga line\*: <q lang="hr">riječ</q> should have an "-i" at the end to indicate a plural (<q lang="hr">riječi</q>). wrote "confusing," not "confusion," and there's a missing letter. also wrong ending in general, for yet-unknown grammar reasons
      - Basil <span lang="hr">nije</span> finish <span lang="hr">učio</span> [doesn't finish learning] <span lang="hr">i je</span> [and is] haunted by, uh. <span lang="hr">Strankinja</span>?? [Stranger, fem]
        - Croatian <span lang="hr">riječi</span> for "teach" and "learn" are the same.
        - I think "strankinja" is closer to "foreigner" than "stranger" but, far as I could find, the <span lang="hr" class="noi">hrvatski riječ</span> makes no distinction.
      - 4.&nbsp;Game Happens (but <span lang="hr">sa hrvatski</span> [with Croatian])
      - these <span lang="hr">su</span> [are] OOC jokes but <span lang="hr">zašto <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;">ne</em></span> [why <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">not</em>] count them ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
      - \>implying whole shebang <span lang="hr">nije</span> [isn't] inherently OOC
        - As in, any of the kids speaking a different language seems like the kind of thing that would've come up if canon, especially because there's at least [one Designated Foreign NPC](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/OTHERMART_LADY#TRIVIA). I fucking love the idea, though.
      - 5.&nbsp;<span lang="hr">nakon</span> [after] Gaem, "bonding." <span lang="hr">ili nešto</span> [or something]
      - <span lang="hr">Nastavljati</span> [To continue]...?
        - "To *be* continued" should be <q lang="hr">Nastavit će se</q> (<span lang="hr" class="noi">hvala</span> Weeb!)\*
      
      ----
      
      \*This whole saga (of <span lang="hr">Škrabotine</span> (Scribbles) in general, not just this one) is a time capsule of what I did/n't know at the time tbh. Like, as of writing (May&nbsp;1) I can independently spot some issues in the older doodles---<q lang="hr">što **li** <span lang="en">[behind door]</span>,</q> unnecessary/redundant pronouns, case and tense shenanigans..\.. Also, although I'm not keeping track, a *majority* of these Škrabotine have been edited between initial drawing and the upload that goes live.
      
      I don't really have A Formal Procedure for this! If it's something I messed up despite knowledge I had at the time, I'll probably change it, or at least make a note of it for publication here later. (With this lore-wall *specifically,* I've just learned A Lot over the past >couple weeks!) But retroactively, I'm probably not gonna touch either art or writing, because that way a neverending ouroboros of self-correction lies.

      "Animated," in the context of Croatian grammatical case, is roughly equivalent to "alive." It also applies to dead people and ghosts.

    note: |-
      A [follow-up](../hrvatski/tr), brought to you by: the belated realization that Croatian has different words for playing different things, and characters' reactions being very much not synonymous with mine.
        
      There is an unusual amount of <span lang="hr" class="noi">hrvatski</span> in this one because I was partway through the second line's translation, realized it was Basil talking and could thus be more English, but didn't want to *not* use what I had (even though it ended up being mostly off). It's Characterization, <span lang="hr" class="noi">ili nešto</span>.

        Basil's line here has been left deliberately wonky. One bit was on purpose: <q lang="hr">sebe,</q> "myself," can be shortened as <q lang="hr">se,</q> which sounds more natural most of the time. The rest was less intended: "to trick into" is not a term in Croatian; likewise, "insult" isn't used in this context, and the phrase would be better translated as "embarrass myself."
