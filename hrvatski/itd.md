Basil’s version, however, as read aloud by Aubrey: “‘You care about your flowers’… ‘You worry about your friends’… ‘You take care of photography’… and you’re interested in spiders.” Basil is affirmative. Aubrey… less so."

      Essentially this plays on various ways to express care/concern. Which I *think* the sequence covers as-is, but for extra clarity (all examples in first-person singular):
      - <q lang="hr">Stalo mi je do [nešto],</q> as you may have gathered from [last round](../hrvatski/yaoi#yaoi), ≈ "I care about [something]," [specifically](https://www.easy-croatian.com/2014/11/52.html) like one might care about a friend. <q lang="hr">Stalo mi je do mojih prijatelja</q> ≈ "I care about my friends."
      - <q lang="hr">Brinem za [nešto]</q> *is* about worry, but the connotations aren't positive; think "I worry about you (because you're in trouble, I'm afraid for you)."
        - In retrospect "I'm worried for spiders" is a little weird, but Basil being Basil I guess it kiiinda works anyway?
      - <q lang="hr">Brinem **se** za [nešto],</q> meanwhile, expresses that the speaker cares for something in the taking-care-of way.
      - Last but not least, <q lang="hr">zanima me [nešto]</q> is a hobby-type care/interest. Basil being interested in spiders isn't... *technically* wrong..\..
