    alt: Kel walks along, minding his own business, when abruptly Aubrey yells at Basil. Basil screams, with question marks, in response.

      With thanks to [r/Croatia](https://old.reddit.com/r/croatian/comments/l0o67a/meaning_and_usage_of_tvojima/) for pointing me towards the "let's go." <q lang="hr">Ajmo</q> is shortened; like "let us go" to "let's go," no one uses the long version.

    an: With thanks, again, to [r/Croatian](https://old.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/hwt69r/how_to_say_shut_the_fuck_up_in_croatian/). Kel's "bass-eel" references how "Basil" might sound with an accent; the Croatian letter "i" sounds like "ee," and there's no equivalent of the English "ay"-as-in-"may" sound. Don't make fun of people's accents, kids.

    alt: "Basil puts pieces together. Meanwhile, a talk: Aubrey: “I’m not ‘torturing’ him,” (Kel: “Tormenting.” Aubrey: “/Whatever/”) “I gave him /one/ sentence to translate… an /hour/ ago.” Kel: “You /sure/ that’s not torture—” Aubrey: “He /knows/ the pieces, he’s just gotta…” Then Basil mutters something."

      Aubrey's <q lang="hr">Š</q> is something of a pun; in Croatian, that's a letter that sounds like "sh."

The sentence was <q>Mari is listening to the violin playing of her brother Sunny.</q>

- Translation I landed on, as dramatic-anime-yelled by Basil above:  
<q lang="hr">Mari je sluša violina igranje njezina brata Sunnya.</q>
- Translation from Weeb, an actual native speaker:  
<q lang="hr">Mari sluša igranje violine njezinog brata Sunnyja.</q>

Google&nbsp;Translate understands my version, though obviously I still missed a few pieces. It did legitimately take an hour!!
