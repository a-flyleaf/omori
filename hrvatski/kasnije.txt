"careful" is mostly self-explanatory, But
- "brinem za" *is* worry, but the connotations aren't positive; think "I worry about you (because you're in trouble, I'm afraid for you)"
- "zanima me" is a hobby-type interest. Being interested in spiders isn't... *technically* wrong....
- not actually 100% sure if the word is "fotografi**ja**" (photograph) or "fotografi**ranje**" (photography) because Wikipedia https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fotografija implies the former??
- ... I suppose...
- Attempt 2.
- [] ostatak = [Finish] the rest.
- Hocu! = I will!
- Ali, jest istina = But, it IS true
- Attempt 3... (will be the charm?)
- Zanima te vrtlarstvo = You're interested in gardening
- Brinem se za baku = I take care of grandmother
- Odlicno = excellent
- Nesto = Something
- To znaci = That means...?
- Brinem za sve = I worry about everything
- U redu = Okay
- stalo mi je do tebe = I care about... you!
- gotovi smo = we're done
- Dobro = good.

[NOT CHECKED YET]
To osjećaj kad bojao se si **ničemu**. | That feeling when you were afraid of **nothing**.
<allcaps>Sve ovih godina *bojao se si ***ničemu***</allcaps> | ALL THESE YEARS YOU WERE AFRAID OF *NOTHING*

"Ni o čemu" is not the big deal it was made out to be: it means "about nothing."
