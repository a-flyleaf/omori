+add publication dates to all these pages, maybe at the top (edits/updates not included)... in general the first two can be converted to the Actual Layout, feel free to save copies of the OG too since the images won't change

also the standalone comics don't Have to be in the art index I don't think... relatedly neither does the piano gif thing, maybe there can be like, a smaller/supplemental section?? same layout same page just not in the _art collection idk

      Croatian and English tenses are not, by a long shot, 1:1. Besides that, I had a weird amount of trouble with this *specific* line from [last round](hrvatski/ostatak-aprila#bonding)---and even got it wrong the first time *here,* hence the little correction.

"careful" is mostly self-explanatory, But
- "brinem za" *is* worry, but the connotations aren't positive; think "I worry about you (because you're in trouble, I'm afraid for you)"
- "zanima me" is a hobby-type interest. Being interested in spiders isn't... *technically* wrong....
- not actually 100% sure if the word is "fotografi**ja**" (photograph) or "fotografi**ranje**" (photography) because Wikipedia https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fotografija implies the former??
- ... I suppose...
- Attempt 2.
- [] ostatak = [Finish] the rest.

- Brinem se za baku = I take care of grandmother
- Odlicno = excellent
- Nesto = Something
- To znaci = That means...?
- Brinem za sve = I worry about everything
- U redu = Okay
- stalo mi je do tebe = I care about... you!
