    - alt: “Hey, Sunny—” Aubrey approaches Sunny and says something nice in Croatian. He doesn’t get it, to her annoyance. She yells to Basil, who’s been watching from a distance; “Ugh, sorry about this, Sunny; forget I said anyth—” Basil, in a panic, yells “W-wait—No no no no ne [no]—!!!”

        <sup>[1]</sup> Word order makes the English version a little weird here; <q lang="hr">jako</q> is the emphasizer, and goes [before the thing being emphasized](https://www.easy-croatian.com/2014/11/8.html). A more natural English version of the line, hesitation intact, would be "I care about you... a lot," but the translation keeps the Croatian word order because otherwise the ellipses don't line up.
        
        <sup>[2]</sup> Technically translates to "lacks knowledge" but the intention was like, "no thoughts head empty," with the "he has" being implicit.
    - alt: Basil approaches, anxious. “I-it’s because—! No, uh,” and then he starts muttering in both English and Croatian, trying to piece a sentence together. Sunny and Aubrey stare at him. Then he finally gets the words out, in an angry exclamation that pisses Aubrey off—but she’s relegated to the background as Basil grabs Sunny’s wrists. He smiles desperately. “S-Sunny— Y-you understand, don’t you?” Basil sputters. (Aubrey exclaims something in the background. Basil continues unfettered:) “A-after all this time, I…” (One more word from Aubrey.) “I want you t—” Then Basil switches to Croatian.

        Thus begins the B-grade. Correct phrases would be <q lang="hr">mačku moj</q> and <q lang="hr">sreco moja</q>; they remain uncorrected for the usual "artist couldn't have known better with the knowledge had at the time" reasons.
        
        <sup>[3]</sup> Used as a term of endearment; citations [one](https://www.expatincroatia.com/croatian-terms-of-endearment/) and [two](https://old.reddit.com/r/croatian/comments/x8pn0b/terms_of_endearment/inkrwuk/). (Fun fact, I flip-flopped *so hard* on whether to use this before remembering Basil straight-up likens Sunny to a kitten in [a birthday photo](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/PHOTO_ALBUM?file=FA_ALBUM_33.png#REAL_WORLD).)
    - alt: "Basil echoes something Aubrey said earlier; Sunny looks in her direction. The… irritation? secondhand embarassment? is real. / Back to Basil, he continues the echo but with very, /very/ particular emphasis. Then: “Soooo, whaddaya say~?”"

Besides that, Basil's line has been left wonky on purpose again (<q lang="hr">želim ~~smo biti~~ **da budemo** vrlo bliski prijatelji</q>), because grammatical tense.
    - alt: "Sunny thought bubble: 1. Aubrey said one thing; question mark. 2. Basil said another; heart. 3. Both dialogues had “mi je stalo do tebe” and “prijatelji.” 4.

        Not translating this one because you can probably piece it together ;V
