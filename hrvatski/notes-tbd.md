Sunny, oprosti da sam napao tvoje oko.
	Sunny, I'm sorry that I attacked your eye
	"Da" usually means "yes," but in this *specific* context it also stands in for "that": If it's used in an independent clause (e.g. "Sorry that <u>I attacked your eye</u>"), then "da" as "that" checks out; otherwise (e.g. "Sorry for attacking your eye"), then *nope*.
Nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
	Something isn't alright with me./Something is wrong with me.*
Hval--- "oprosti"??
	Thank--- "forgive me"??
	As noted earlier, "oprosti" most literally translates to "forgive me" but is used in less formal contexts than the English version.
On ni ne zna hrvatski....
	He doesn't even know Croatian....

*This bit gave me issues; the original thought was "I have problems," and after I ran around in a small circle trying to use pinpoint a more specific word for "problems," Weeb nudged me back to a 1:1 translation. (Alternatives: "I have issues," "I am dysfunctional/mentally ill," "I am unwell." General sentiment of "I'm fucked up [but not phrased in an overly clinical or serious way]." "There's something wrong with me" sounded a bit harsh in English but ¯\\\_(&nbsp;:V&nbsp;)_/¯, I do not have enough cultural context for a better phrasing!)

"Jest neživ." "It is not animated."

"Animated," in the context of Croatian grammatical case, is roughly equivalent to "alive"---except it also applies to dead people and ghosts.

"ghosts pasta????" inside joke. Ghosts of Past. don't worry about it

	"---pred! Sunnyom!!!"\*
	"Ponavljam: *nije* razumije jezi[k]---"
	"Znaš...."
	{sigh} "Također, žao mi je da sam rekla da nešto nije u redu s tobom."
	[open]
	"Hvala. / Now, *actually* tell me how to say, [and]--- *i **ponavljam***---"
	"Isuse. Zašto...."
EN
	"Hey, Basil--- I'm sorry I gave you the wrong word for playing a musical instrument."
	[attempted] "ALSO--- you tried to trick me into insulting myself--- in front! of Sunny!!!"
	("What? ...'you embarrass yourself'??")\*
	"I repeat: [He] *doesn't* understand the lang[uage]---"
	"I know...."
	{sigh} "And, I'm sorry I said there's something wrong with you.."
	[open]
	"Thanks. / Now, *actually* tell me how to say, and--- *and **I repeat***---"
	"Jesus. Why...."
- \*Basil's line here has been left deliberately wonky. One bit was on purpose: "sebe," "myself," can be shortened as "se," which sounds more natural most of the time. As for the rest: "to trick into" is not a term in Croatian; likewise, "insult myself" would be better translated as "embarrass myself" ("se osramotim"); and the end-bit for "Sunny" should be "-em," not "-om," because of the end sound. It's Characterization, or something. (...honestly, I just didn't realize it could've been left English until partway through the translation, at which point I wasn't gonna *not* use what I had, so.)
- "sigh" as onomatopoeia not really a Thing in croatian so I just used the english version
