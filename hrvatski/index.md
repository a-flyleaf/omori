      It started with a bad pun. "I fuck your [thing]," as opposed to "fuck *you*," is [a common insult](https://piped.video/watch?v=JpRqxbtAnHw&t=74) in Croatian; it's akin to saying "fuck the sun whose glow you bask in." (Video features Serbian actors but the example serves nonetheless.) Yeah, I know, I know, using a foreign language for the express purpose of swearing; the "sun" pun was too good (awful?) to pass up.
      
      Corrections were required.

Thus, corrected sentence: <q lang="hr">Ne miješaj Sunnyja u ovo.</q> (Basil got a B anyway, though, because if <span lang="hr">izostaviti</span> <em>had</em> been right, the resulting <q lang="hr">Izostavi Sunnyja iz ovoga</q> would’ve been much closer!)</p><p>Finally, turns out both apology words were relevant, but in different contexts. <span lang="hr">Oprosti</span> = “forgive me,” which is used more casually than its English analogue.</p></figcaption></figure>

      At one point, in discussing exceptions to basic rules, Weeb suggested (to paraphrase) "Pull a Sunny! Acknowledge existence of [weirdness], then *damn the word to ~~hell~~ Black Space*."

      All credits to Weeb for the concept. Intended translation was "Language [Catastrophe](https://piped.garudalinux.org/watch?v=WB5XqJJHzC8)" but it accidentally turned into "Language *of* Catastrophe," which is IMO funnier.

      Prequel to the last one, or something. Croatian <span lang="hr">brat</span> is actually pronounced similarly to English "brother," with the <i>a</i> in <span lang="hr">brat</span> sounding like "<u>a</u>bout," but you wouldn't get that from writing alone.

      Belated follow-up, or "he_would_not_say_that.png". (The incorrect version uses "return" as a noun, e.g. "the return [recurrence] of the errors;" correction uses "return" as a verb, e.g. "return [go back] to the source.")

      Learned about emphasis! Immediately learned about its origin and a very weird use case. ("<span lang="hr">Htjeti</span>" is very much one of the Cursed Words.) Who knew the simple act of desiring (and/or, desiring *to do*) could be so fraught...!
      
      \*Also note that "I'll try my best" apparently doesn't translate as a phrase, for lack of the concept of 'doing one's best.' An alternate approximation is <q lang="hr">Ja ću dati sve od sebe,</q> literally "I will give everything from myself."

Essentially: started with <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/woe-plague-be-upon-ye">the original meme</a>’s words (“Woe! Croatian be upon ye!”) → changed the grammar & exact word meanings (mostly because “be upon ye” <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/be+upon">wtf even</a>) → “sad! Croatian is your problem” → shoved the words I didn’t know into an auto-translator and general search → duct-taped it all together → <em>Memeage Complete</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
      
      There are more accurate words that could've been used here ("<span lang="hr">jad</span>" for woe, and "<span lang="hr">nesreća</span>" *technically* means "misfortune" or "trouble" but more commonly conveys "accident" or "disaster") but I *think* I got the gist down anyway.
