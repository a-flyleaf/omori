    - alt: A very bashful Basil asks Aubrey, “How would I say—‘Sunny, you’re my entire world! I love you so much!’ Aubrey stares at him, then answers. Basil recognizes a word, and not for the better; Aubrey bonks him on the head, muttering.”

      <sup>[1]</sup> <span lang="hr">"Da"</span> usually means "yes," but in this *specific* context it also stands in for "that": If it's used in an independent clause (e.g. "Sorry <u>that I attacked your eye</u>"), then <span lang="hr">"da"</span> as "that" checks out; unlike in English, the "<span lang="hr">da</span>/that" isn't dropped. Otherwise (e.g. "Sorry for attacking your eye"), no dice.
      
      <sup>[2]</sup> This bit gave me issues; the original thought was "I have problems," and after I ran around in a small circle trying to use pinpoint a more specific word for "problems," Weeb nudged me back to a 1:1 translation. (Alternatives: "I have issues," "I am dysfunctional/mentally&nbsp;ill," "I am unwell." General sentiment of "I'm fucked&nbsp;up [but not phrased in an overly clinical or serious way]." "There's something wrong with me" sounded a bit harsh in English but ¯\\\_(&nbsp;:V&nbsp;)_/¯, I do not have enough cultural context for a better phrasing!)

      Since this is basically <span lang="hr" class="noi">jezik</span> pingpong, here's the whole thing in one go:
      - "<s>Ya like lore?</s> <span lang="hr">Uživaš li priča?</span>" [lit. "Do you enjoy story?"]
        - "Lore," being more of a Meme Word, could've been left as-is.
      - <span lang="hr">Početak</span>. [Beginning.]
      - 1.&nbsp;Aubrey inexplicably <span lang="hr">hrvat</span> [a Croat], <span lang="hr">učio</span> [teaches] Basil (some) <span lang="hr">hrvatski</span> [Croatian]...
      - 2.&nbsp;others <span lang="hr">nisu znaju</span> [don't know] shit tho (otherwise canon as normal)
      - 3.&nbsp;Shit Happens.
      - <span lang="hr">Crni Prostor <span lang="en">ft.</span> Riječ... Zbujenog?</span> [Black Space ft. Words of... Confusion?]
        - <q lang="hr">riječ</q> should have an "-i" at the end to indicate a plural, whoops; <q lang="hr">riječi</q>
      - Basil <span lang="hr">nije</span> finish <span lang="hr">učio</span> [doesn't finish learning] <span lang="hr">i je</span> [and is] haunted by, uh. <span lang="hr">Strankinja</span>?? [Stranger, fem]
        - Croatian <span lang="hr">riječi</span> for "teach" and "learn" are the same.
        - I think "strankinja" is closer to "foreigner" than "stranger" but, far as I could find, the <span lang="hr" class="noi">hrvatski riječ</span> makes no distinction.
      - 4.&nbsp;Game Happens (but <span lang="hr">sa hrvatski</span> [with Croatian])
      - these <span lang="hr">su</span> [are] OOC jokes but <span lang="hr">zašto <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;">ne</em></span> [why <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">not</em>] count them ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
      - \>implying whole shebang <span lang="hr">nije</span> [isn't] inherently OOC
        - As in, like, much as I adore the idea of *anyone* speaking not-English, that seems like the kind of thing that would've come up? especially when there's at least [one Designated Foreign NPC](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/OTHERMART_LADY#TRIVIA)...
      - 5.&nbsp;<span lang="hr">nakon</span> [after] Gaem, "bonding." <span lang="hr">ili nešto</span> [or something]

    an: |-
      "Animated," in the context of Croatian grammatical case, is roughly equivalent to "alive"---except it also applies to dead people and ghosts.

    note: |-
      A [follow-up](hrvatski/tr), brought to you by: the belated realization that Croatian has different words for playing different things, and characters' reactions being very much not synonymous with mine.
        
      There is an unusual amount of <span lang="hr" class="noi">hrvatski</span> in this one because I was partway through the second line's translation, realized it was Basil talking and could thus be more English, but didn't want to *not* use what I had (even though it ended up being mostly off). It's Characterization, or something.

    - alt: While yelling about Sunny, Basil scribbles furiously over a language notebook. One word from the anime power-up sentence is wrong; over a perfectly nice caption about how impessed Sunny would be, Basil writes, “Why is Aubrey (still) so mean to me?!”

        Basil's line here has been left deliberately wonky. One bit was on purpose: <q lang="hr">sebe,</q> "myself," can be shortened as <q lang="hr">se,</q> which sounds more natural most of the time. The rest was less intended: "to trick into" is not a term in Croatian; likewise, "insult" isn't used in this context, and the phrase would be better translated as "embarrass myself."
        
        It's&nbsp;Characterization, or something.
