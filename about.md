Hi there~ I'm [a-flyleaf](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/) and <i class="omo">Omori</i> has taken over my life. I don't use social media these days but wanted to dump my unhinged scrawlings *somewhere*, and since I know how to code, this site exists! There are no secrets in the HTML, but feel free to poke around.<!--You fucker. ;V ...But seriously, this is it. Any other code comments are notes-to-self that I probably forgot to delete.-->

## Why is the back button at the bottom of every page so pointy?
I spent over half the game thinking those squiggly little guys in White Space were forks and not hands. To commemorate my lunacy I've made them actual forks here.

<div id="fork"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/fork.png" alt="A White Space hand, but with thin, long, pointed “fingers” like a fork." title="A White Space hand, but with thin, long, pointed “fingers” like a fork."></div>

## Stats, for fun.
- <b>Foe Facts</b>: Someone who refuses to be associated with a visual personae. A little obsessive.
- ~~Favorite character~~ <b>Character tierlist<!--this can be a link later--> in a nutshell</b>: Aubrey & Kel \>\> Sunny/Omori & Basil > Mari & Hero (sorry. damned by lack of strong feelings, not active dislike)
- <b>Favorite scenes</b>: "It Means Everything." (full church scene; before, during, and after) & Omori boss fight for the drama; ghost dance cutscene for the Top 10 Heartwarming Moments Before Certain Disaster
- <b>Has played Hikikomori</b>: Not yet....
- <b>Plays piano</b>: With the aptitude of someone who's gotten really good at paint-by-numbers but doesn't understand anatomy. Nonetheless, yes!
- <b>Other RPGs played</b>: [<i class="omo">Off</i>](https://off.fandom.com/wiki/OFF_Wiki), [<i class="omo">Undertale</i>](https://undertale.com/) + [<i>deltarune</i>](https://deltarune.com/), and a handful of <i>Pokémon</i> installments
- <b>Most likely to</b>:
	- point at <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">Off</i> references and go "That's an <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">Off</i> reference :D"
	- froth at the mouth about any sort of visual and/or thematic parallel
	- draw absolutely insane conclusions from breadcrumb similarities
	- get pummeled into fetal position by Steel Folding Chairs™ of "that offhand comment wasn't *supposed* to bite back later---" liveblogging caliber
- <b>Assorted childhood memories that hint vaguely at an age</b>: Watching VHS tapes on a giant TV that made your hair stand up if you got close. Sticking fingers in casette tapes to rewind them (and sometimes rendering them unplayable forever in the process!). "Can I play on the computer?". Looking over cousins' shoulders in bewilderment as they played Tamagotchis. All in all, spending probably too much time at a screen, but nonetheless a hell of a lot less than whatever the kids and their smartphones are doing these days.
- <b>Remembers dial-up</b>: No.
- <b>Relates to "90s kid" memes</b>: It's a roulette....
- <b>Was around for Geocities-type web design</b>: Absolutely not, but vaguely influenced by it in making this site anyway.
- <b>Has had fucked-up dreams about teeth</b>: Inexplicably, on multiple occasions. They cronch.

## Thabks...
...to Omocat (studio, and also person) for making this beautiful thing.
