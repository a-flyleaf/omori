## Fanmade Resources
- <b>[Fandom Wiki](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/OMORI_WIKI)</b> (+ [Breezewiki frontend](https://breezewiki.com/omori/wiki/OMORI_WIKI))  
Seems to treat some fanon information as canon (notably in story & character descriptions, and assigning names to [places without]({%include url.html%}/black-space)) but overall a decent reference. Wish it had better organization & actual sources for the artwork galleries....
- <b>[goats.dev data dump](https://goats.dev/omori/)</b>  
Scripts, maps, and other techy mumbo-jumbo ripped straight from the game. Includes unused dialogue, though the dialogue files aren't all chronological.
- <b>[Let's Play Archive](https://lparchive.org/Omori/)</b>  
A forum-based playthrough of the entire game, with most dialogue transcribed, some gifs, and videos of various (if not all?) endings. The LPer has made some presentation desicions I'm not crazy about\*, <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">but</em> it's nonetheless an A+ resource for reskimming the plot and major dialogues. Plus, unlike a video, ~it's&nbsp;skimmable~
	- \*~~nitpicky grievances~~ Things to note: LPer has given talksprites to characters without, including spirit!Mari (who has a sprite sheet in the files but only one is used in-game), and inserted dialogue in the Omori fight without making clear this is an insert. Although there's some commentary from the LPer, it's sparse; there are no, say, snarky jokes between every other line or incoherent keysmashing about dramatic moments. Both of which are #valid and have their place, but they'd make the LP a lot less useful as a game reference, y'know? 
- <b>[Omoriboy Archive](https://alexanderjt.neocities.org/omoriboy)</b>  
Manually-created mirror of the blog posts that started it all. The original blogs are inaccessible even with a Tumblr login, but some (if not all?) posts were [reblogged by Omocat](https://www.omocat-blog.com/tagged/omori/chrono).
- <b>[The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/OMORI)</b>  
Massive, *massive* pages detailing various content from the files that got cut and/or changed between versions. And as of November 2023, they're still not done!!
- <b>[Spriters Resource spriterips](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/omori/)</b>  
As of November 2023 this is neither comprehensive nor well-organized, with [the Switch sprites being a separate page entirely](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nintendo_switch/omori/). But in a pinch, it loads a lot faster than the Fandom pages.
- <b>[RPG-Maker Restore-Images](https://petschko.org/tools/mv_decrypter/)</b>  
Not technically <span class="omo">Omori</span>-related, but if you own the game on Steam, you can use this to rip the sprite sheets yourself ;V (Requires familiarity with your Program Files to find the dang things. Might make a page/folder guide about this later....) (also see: [Unused Graphics at TCRF](https://tcrf.net/OMORI/Unused_Graphics) (main page linked above))
	- you can get the music this way, too! have yet to do that myself, though; stay tuned.... <small>(pun not intended.)</small>
- <b>[OST Heardle](https://omori-heardle-2-5.glitch.me/)</b>  
Not technically a *resource,* I Just Think [It's Fun](heardle)
