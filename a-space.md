# ABOUT (Omori? standing on the homepage, sitting on the actual page)
Hi there~ I'm [a-flyleaf](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/) and <i class="omo">Omori</i> has taken over my life. I don't use social media these days but wanted to dump my unhinged scrawlings *somewhere,* and I *do* know how to code, so this site exists! There are no secrets in the HTML, but feel free to poke around.<!--You fucker. ;V ...But seriously, this is it. Any other code comments are notes-to-self that I probably forgot to delete.-->

## Why is the back button at the bottom of every page so pointy?
I spent like a third of the game thinking those squiggly little guys in White Space were forks and not hands. To commemorate my lunacy I've made them actual forks here.

## Stats, for fun.
- <b>Foe Facts</b>: Someone who refuses to be associated with a visual personae. A little obsessive.
- ~~Favorite character~~ <b>Character tierlist<!--this can be a link later--> in a nutshell</b>: Aubrey & Kel \>\> Sunny/Omori & Basil > Mari & Hero (sorry. damned by lack of strong feelings, not active dislike)
- <b>Favorite scenes</b>: "It Means Everything." scene (including talk before the fight) & Omori boss fight for the drama; ghost dance cutscene for the Top 10 Heartwarming Moments Before Certain Disaster
- <b>Has played Hikikomori</b>: Not yet....
- <b>Plays piano</b>: With the aptitude of someone who's gotten really good at paint-by-numbers but doesn't understand anatomy. Nonetheless, yes!
- <b>Other RPGs played</b>: [<i class="omo">Off</i>](https://off.fandom.com/wiki/OFF_Wiki), [<i class="omo">Undertale</i>](https://undertale.com/) + [<i>deltarune</i>](https://deltarune.com/), and a handful of <i>Pokémon</i> installments
- <b>Most likely to</b>:
	- point at <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">Off</i> references and go "That's an <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">Off</i> reference :D"
	- froth at the mouth about any sort of visual and/or thematic parallel
	- draw absolutely insane conclusions from breadcrumb similarities
	- get pummeled into fetal position by Steel Folding Chairs™ of "that offhand comment wasn't *supposed* to bite back later---" liveblogging caliber
- <b>Assorted childhood memories that hint vaguely at an age</b>: Watching VHS tapes on a giant TV that made your hair stand up if you got close. Sticking fingers in casette tapes to rewind them (and sometimes rendering them unplayable forever in the process!). "Can I play on the computer?". Looking over cousins' shoulders in bewilderment as they played Tamagotchis. All in all, spending probably too much time at a screen, but nonetheless a hell of a lot less than whatever the kids and their smartphones are doing these days.
- <b>Remembers dial-up</b>: No.
- <b>Relates to "90s kid" memes</b>: It's a roulette....
- <b>Was around for Geocities-type web design</b>: Absolutely not, but vaguely influenced by it in making this site anyway.
- <b>Has had fucked-up dreams about teeth</b>: Inexplicably, on multiple occasions. They cronch.

## Thabks...
...to Omocat (studio, and also person) for making this beautiful thing.  
...to my friend [?], with whom I had a hell of a Gaem Time.  
...and to you, random internet denizen, for clicking around and finding out.

## Fanmade Resources
- [Fandom Wiki](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/OMORI_WIKI) (+ [Breezewiki frontend](https://breezewiki.com/omori/wiki/OMORI_WIKI))  
Seems to treat some fanon information as canon (notably in story & character descriptions, and assigning names to [places without]({%include url.html%}/black-space) but overall a decent reference. Wish it had better organization & actual sources for the artwork galleries....
- [goats.dev dialogue dump](https://goats.dev/omori/)  
I have no idea what half of this means or why the in-file organization is jumbled, but it's often cited for unused dialogue.
- [Let's Play Archive](https://lparchive.org/Omori/)  
A forum-based playthrough of the entire game, with most dialogue transcribed, some gifs, and videos of various (if not all?) endings. The LPer has made some presentation desicions I'm not crazy about\*, <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">but</em> it's nonetheless an A+ resource for reskimming the plot and major dialogues. Plus, unlike a video, ✨it's skimmable✨
	- nitpicky grievances include: giving talksprites to characters without, including spirit!Mari (who has a sprite sheet in the files but all but one are unused in-game); inserting dialogue in the Omori fight which is *not* there in-game, without making clear this is an insert; and not noting some minor details like flavor text & cutscene actions. That said, while there's some commentary from the LPer, it's nothing like, say, snarky jokes at every other line or incoherent keysmashing about dramatic moments. Both of which are #valid and have their place, but they'd make it a lot less useful as a game reference, y'know? 
- [Omoriboy Archive](https://alexanderjt.neocities.org/omoriboy)  
Manually-created mirror of the blog posts that started it all. The original blogs are inaccessible even with a Tumblr login, but some (if not all?) posts were [reblogged by Omocat](https://www.omocat-blog.com/tagged/omori/chrono).
- [Spriters Resource spriterips](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/omori/)  
At the time of writing this is neither comprehensive nor well-organized, with [the Switch sprites being a separate page entirely](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nintendo_switch/omori/). Still loads a lot faster than the Fandom pages in a pinch.
- [RPG-Maker Restore-Images](https://petschko.org/tools/mv_decrypter/)  
Not technically <span class="omo">Omori</span>-related, but if you own the game on Steam, you can use this to rip the sprite sheets yourself ;V (Requires familiarity with your Program Files to find the dang things. Might make a page/folder guide about this later....)

# BLOG (laptop)
- 2023-02-20: Today I thought about <i class="omo">Omori</i>. Made this site.
	- art: gifs for the homepage
	- code: core layouts/site setup
	- full page: splash (index.html)
	- words: main content (full about & links, notes for other pages)
	- full page: Black Space reference table
- 2023-02-20: Today I thought about <i class="omo">Omori</i>. Continued working on site.
	- full page: nothing here (404.html)
	- art+code: back button
- 2023-02-??: Today I thought about <i class="omo">Omori</i>. [Did something else.]

# ART (sketchbook)
Scribbles and scrawlings. Feel free to use for whatever, just link back here somehow~

- January roundup
- Omori boss fight redraw (combined + variants)
- Basil birthday
- February roundup is inevitable at this point

+would be neat to have an idea dump somewhere

# FREUDIAN CONSPIRACY HELL (tissues)
[scrawled-up jpeg diagram, then slap it on a pepe silvia meme]  
"What does it mean? What does it all mean???"

# other pages (Omori? ---no wait he's already the about uhh. hm. mini door?? yeah that makes more sense I think)
- [Black Space.](black-space)
- guide to ripping the sprites + what the folders actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- version for me, as of first playthrough
	- for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically idetical but not markdown-specific
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something. the omori page can be a hub for all this
	- "a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/omori"... mewo (mewo). omori (omori). vri

# MEWO (Mewo)
