## Fanmade Resources
- [Fandom Wiki](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/OMORI_WIKI) (+ [Breezewiki frontend](https://breezewiki.com/omori/wiki/OMORI_WIKI))  
Seems to treat some fanon information as canon (notably in story & character descriptions, and assigning names to [places without]({%include url.html%}/black-space) but overall a decent reference. Wish it had better organization & actual sources for the artwork galleries....
- [goats.dev dialogue dump](https://goats.dev/omori/)  
I have no idea what half of this means or why the in-file organization is jumbled, but it's often cited for unused dialogue.
- [Let's Play Archive](https://lparchive.org/Omori/)  
A forum-based playthrough of the entire game, with most dialogue transcribed, some gifs, and videos of various (if not all?) endings. The LPer has made some presentation desicions I'm not crazy about\*, <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">but</em> it's nonetheless an A+ resource for reskimming the plot and major dialogues. Plus, unlike a video, ✨it's skimmable✨
	- nitpicky grievances include: giving talksprites to characters without, including spirit!Mari (who has a sprite sheet in the files but all but one are unused in-game); inserting dialogue in the Omori fight which is *not* there in-game, without making clear this is an insert; and not noting some minor details like flavor text & cutscene actions. That said, while there's some commentary from the LPer, it's nothing like, say, snarky jokes at every other line or incoherent keysmashing about dramatic moments. Both of which are #valid and have their place, but they'd make it a lot less useful as a game reference, y'know? 
- [Omoriboy Archive](https://alexanderjt.neocities.org/omoriboy)  
Manually-created mirror of the blog posts that started it all. The original blogs are inaccessible even with a Tumblr login, but some (if not all?) posts were [reblogged by Omocat](https://www.omocat-blog.com/tagged/omori/chrono).
- [Spriters Resource spriterips](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/omori/)  
At the time of writing this is neither comprehensive nor well-organized, with [the Switch sprites being a separate page entirely](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nintendo_switch/omori/). Still loads a lot faster than the Fandom pages in a pinch.
- [RPG-Maker Restore-Images](https://petschko.org/tools/mv_decrypter/)  
Not technically <span class="omo">Omori</span>-related, but if you own the game on Steam, you can use this to rip the sprite sheets yourself ;V (Requires familiarity with your Program Files to find the dang things. Might make a page/folder guide about this later....)

# BLOG (laptop)
- 2023-02-20: Today I thought about <i class="omo">Omori</i>. Made this site.
	- art: gifs for the homepage
	- code: core layouts/site setup
	- full page: splash (index.html)
	- words: main content (full about & links, notes for other pages)
	- full page: Black Space reference table
- 2023-02-20: Today I thought about <i class="omo">Omori</i>. Continued working on site.
	- full page: nothing here (404.html)
	- art+code: back button
	- code: text layout
	- code: About page
- 2023-02-??: Today I thought about <i class="omo">Omori</i>. [Did something else.]

# ART (sketchbook)
Scribbles and scrawlings. Feel free to use for whatever, just link back here somehow~

- January roundup
- Omori boss fight redraw (combined + variants)
- Basil birthday
- February roundup is inevitable at this point

+would be neat to have an idea dump somewhere

# FREUDIAN CONSPIRACY HELL (tissues)
[scrawled-up jpeg diagram, then slap it on a pepe silvia meme]  
"What does it mean? What does it all mean???"

# other pages (mini door, draw a new one)
- [Black Space.](black-space)
- guide to ripping the sprites + what the folders actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- version for me, as of first playthrough
	- for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically idetical but not markdown-specific
- CDs!! they're not in the official OST. could be extended to other not-OST track videos, like slowed versions in Black Space 2?
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something. the omori page can be a hub for all this
	- "a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/omori"... mewo (mewo). omori (omori). vri
