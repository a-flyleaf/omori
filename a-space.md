ABOUT: Omori

LINKS: lightbulb

CHANGELOG: laptop

ART: sketchbook
- layouts should be good, just need to add & format the actual content
- 6 rows max on individual art pages? or scrap the whole thing & use next/prev hand arrows
- figure out what to do with the footer... include maybe? won't want the full text on bonus pages but the hand is always nice to have, at *least* have the #back css in base file
- probably don't Always need multiple file sizes for the art, but have an optional variable in the page anyway because Some pieces (roundup + omori alters) are Fuckign Huge

HELP?: tissues

# other pages (mini door, draw a new one)
- [Black Space.](black-space)
- guide to ripping the sprites + what the folders actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- version for me, as of first playthrough
	- for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically idetical but not markdown-specific
- CDs!! they're not in the official OST. could be extended to other not-OST track videos, like slowed versions in Black Space 2?
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something. the omori page can be a hub for all this
	- "a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/omori"... mewo (mewo). omori (omori). vri

# MEWO (Mewo)
- Waiting for something to happen? \[details no summary, use the CSS open selector to change the gif]
