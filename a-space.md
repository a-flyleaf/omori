ABOUT: Omori

LINKS: lightbulb

CHANGELOG: laptop

# ART (sketchbook)
Scribbles and scrawlings. Feel free to use for whatever, just link back here somehow~

- January roundup
- Omori boss fight redraw (combined + variants)
- Basil birthday
- February roundup is inevitable at this point

+would be neat to have an idea dump somewhere

# FREUDIAN CONSPIRACY HELL (tissues)
[scrawled-up jpeg diagram, then slap it on a pepe silvia meme]  
"What does it mean? What does it all mean???"

# other pages (mini door, draw a new one)
- [Black Space.](black-space)
- guide to ripping the sprites + what the folders actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- version for me, as of first playthrough
	- for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically idetical but not markdown-specific
- CDs!! they're not in the official OST. could be extended to other not-OST track videos, like slowed versions in Black Space 2?
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something. the omori page can be a hub for all this
	- "a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/omori"... mewo (mewo). omori (omori). vri

# MEWO (Mewo)
- Waiting for something to happen? \[details no summary, use the CSS open selector to change the gif]
