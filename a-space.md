[separate pages & images TBA, just want the content down for now]

- ABOUT (Omori)
	- just a bit about the site, who I am, any posts/pages of note
- LINKS (lightbulb)
	- official: website, bandcamp, social media (both game & devs)
	- fanmade resources: fandom wiki, goats.dev data dump, Omoriboy mirror, spriter's resource + RPGmaker rip
	- me: github homepage, dA
	- recs: fanart, fics, meta
- BLOG (laptop)
	- changelog & short updates; full content elsewhere (pages > posts, not intended to be *too* ephemeral here)
- ART (sketchbook)
	- shameless flagrant fanart-dumping
- BATSHIT FREUDIAN CONSPIRACY WALL (tissue box)
	- . . . eventually. maybe. would be kinda funny to just link a scrawled-up diagram with a pepe silvia meme
- hand-forks to bonus content later?
- MEWO (Mewo)
	- Waiting for something to happen? \[details no summary, use the CSS open selector to change the gif]
