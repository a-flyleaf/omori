In which I attempted to review my initial playthrough and compile thoughts & observations noted throughout.
- <b>[An introduction of some sort.]({%include url.html%}/meta/intropost)</b>: The who (bit about me), the how (approach to the game & meta in general), the why (why tho).
- <b>[January 12: It's all fun and games...]({%include url.html%}/meta/playground)</b>: Early impressions.
- <b>[January 12: theoryloss.jpg]({%include url.html%}/meta/not-playground)</b>: Musings on violence, rabid sprouts, Hero as a concept, and other stuff.
- <b>[intermission snippets]({%include url.html%}/meta/intermission)</b>: Things that didn't fit at the end of last post.
- <b>[[untitled dumpage]]({%include url.html%}/meta/voicemail)</b>: Unfinished continuation.
- <b>[um.]({%include url.html%}/meta/impasse)</b>: Not really meta, just explaining why this got scrapped.

The rest will be, uh, less comprehensive. I think. Or at least less perfectionistically-written.... >\_>\"

## the rest
- <b>[is this a meta]({%include url.html%}/meta/not-meta)</b>: Revisited my save files, made some little observations throughout and also went on a pinwheel tangent.
- <b>[boss rush speedrun]({%include url.html%}/meta/boss-rush)</b>: Notes on the Headspace bosses.

Written without much regard for prior context, nor do I usually bother to explain my various thought tangents or overall analytical process. That way perfectionism lies....
