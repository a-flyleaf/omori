      thinkin about the lake scene again.  
      - <em class="omo">Did Basil leave the Egret flower tho.</em>!!! there’s one in <em class="omo noi">his</em> house, very prominently, and one by the picnic basket! and another at the grave; who knows if he’s visited, not me (yet)!! fuck?!!! (Aubrey wouldn’t have left it surely, not if she hasn’t told the Hooligans anything….)
    note: |-
      In retrospect I think this is one of those details that doesn't need a diegetic explanation. Also, the name "Hooligans" is only used in the battle overlay, never by any of the characters, so at this point I tend to think that's just Sunny's insert.

      > I know it’s sort of a joke song, but Scatman John actually had a pretty inspirational life. **He was born with a stutter that made him too nervous to sing, so he played piano for most of his career.** It was only in his 50s that he decided to become a scat performer and made this song as a way to inspire kids with stutters. It made him a worldwide hit, (especially in Japan for some reason) and he did two more notable songs before he died of lung cancer a few years later at 57. He was completely at peace when he passed, declaring:
      >
      > ‘Whatever God wants is fine by me ... I've had the very best life. I have tasted beauty.’

      random thought wrt Hero’s reaction to the truth: There’s a fucked-up part of him that *wants* to be responsible. He can relate—he *understood* why Mari would’ve done it, if she had. [Kel and Aubrey don’t! They’re not suicidal <em class="omo noi">(thank god)</em> but *Hero* had no comment.] And now he doesn’t even get that?  
      (that could be a fic spark but hmmm. no real further thoughts just a Concept)
      
      later edit re:suicidal thoughts—well, ok, they didn’t get why *mari* did it. the identity of the person in question, and everything they (thought they) knew about her, is A Factor. still Highly doubt kel’s ever considered it, aubrey… less sure, but generally want to say no despite it all.  
      this light is a bit more 8,) on Hero’s part though since it suggests he and Mari were close enough he *would* know she was, or had any sort of tendency in that direction. since they both have chronic perfectionism-itis, Well,,
    note: |-
      The dialogue I'm picking at here is three entire lines from right before the gang revisits the treehouse (entire sequence (and then some) transcribed on [this (very image-heavy) page](https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2043/)):
      > <span class="omo">Kel</span>: "Even after all this time... I-I still don't understand why she would do it.  
      > <span class="omo">Aubrey</span>: "I... I don't think any of us ever will."

      oh forgot if I wrote this down but it does Stick Out To Me a little that, in the pre-Omori bit where Sunny’s friends are backing him up before he steps onstage… Aubrey talks about how he was there for her, then the brothers take over a *majority* of the actual reassurance. Aubrey gets the last word anyway, right up to “break a leg.” also, Basil conspicuously absent, though ig he had his moments—and a hug, too, yet. something something Sunny’s *certain* of his resumed support (and it’s mutual), less sure on the others? thinks Aubrey mostly liked/likes him for what he can *do for* her?? hmmmm.

      unrelatedly, musing again on Hero as an idealized Sunny (and rabies antennae and the like—it made sense in my head in milliseconds ok): ohhh, the Truth is *blue*. it’s blue with tints of red. the theme of everything is Lost Sprout Moles Lash Out and Sunny was very lost (sad! prone to depression, like Hero!), and *that* is ultimately what colors everything. red too, yes, he was *mad* at Mari at the stairs there, that’s what made him snap—but overwhelmingly, he’s sad about it all. which goes without saying really but like, im love colors

      anyway addition to the links page (esp. in tandem with file-ripping) y/y.
    note: |-
      ...I'm tilting my head at this one because the quotes line up with the Fandom page, but I distinctly remember the last parts ("other omori pages here" and "addition to the links page") referring to [a different site entirely](https://tcrf.net/OMORI). Did I accidentally a line? several???? I feel like I had *way* more obvservations from the TCRF site.... >:V
      
      Ah well. Something to revisit later, maybe. It's on [the links page](../links) now!

      thinking about another comment (on it means everything?) mentioning that aubrey's house is full of trash, they said she doesn't like the junkyard much... didn't really notice that myself, reskimming the lp now, some thoughts
      - space bf's house sure *does* have a shortcut to the junkyard! great for gameplay, raises Some Questions wrt sunny and recycling and recycling being a concept (revisiting the same memories over and over, but also turning from trash to something refreshed and new--clean slate-esque)
      - oh yeah, the flower puzzle is in the trash. y'know, daisy's puzzle. for daisy. aubrey trashes the photos irl. doesn't apply if hikikomori but like... puzzle as pho<em class="omo noi">puzzle pieces as photos of course,</em> that's *literally* how you put the truth together!!
      - \>mari's picnic dialogue has her cleaning up "to set an example for my sometimes-messy brother". bruh
        - (for the record that's like, "bruh, sunny <em class="omo noi">does</em> see himself as trash" not like. "oh no how dare Mari tease him about leaving socks on the floor")
      - anyway, yeah, I *do* remember aubrey not liking the smell much, although it didn't (still doesn't) stand out... it's left frustratingly unclear what sunny knew of her home life, and how bad it even was back then, so. conclusion: inconclusive? gonna keep reading...
      - "What the hell, why is everyone so rude at this Junkyard? It's like they're all upset about being tossed aside for being useless." [<https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2008/>] yeah, LPer, why *is* that? almost like being tossed is kinda like being lost....
      - have zero clue what to make of the random cassette that drops exclusively to demonstrate kel's toss-nuke. like, i'm thinking about everything from a "why was it written/designed this way?" perspective, and I Have No Fuckin Clue. (relatedly: they left the key count in?? foreshadowing black space?)<span class="eta">[\*]</span>

      - kel doesn't like milk and warns the cheese--*he's lactose intolerant*
      - super duper extremely Do Not Know what to make of the entire 404 battle. like hewwo? just, in the middle of nowhere?? the recycling cult isn't even real (or if they Are they don't have an hq there--conspicuous location btw)??? i don't even
      - they *acknowledge* the weirdness too, or at least hero does? why does rosa zone out?? i am Full of confusion and befuddlement
      - "But if Space Boyfriend and Sweetheart aren't together anymore, how will we ever wake up Space Boyfriend now? The future of the once-great coalition of Space Pirates is depending on us..." she's so fucking dramatic i love her. where did this go. i want older!aubrey to gush about soap operas

      hear me out: does hero is “malewife” because that makes him effectively harmless to Mari. “no it’s because he’s a separate person entirely” <em class="omo noi">listne. from a “why were they made this way” perspective.</em>
      
      unrelatedly: oh uhh uh something something christmas inherently has a Christ motif, hence religion (plus it meshes with the small town vibe)—but the *specific* religion has been shaved off, much like how christmas itself is semi-secular via ubiquity?  
      edit: <em class="omo noi">oh right</em> sin and guilt!! religion is relevant insofar as it invokes guilt—guilt for not wanting to perform (for not wanting the violin in the first place), guilt for existing (you are trash), guilt over Basil and Something (it’s literally called the Church of Something). christmas is the catalyst *and* the embodiment, in that sense; iirc that’s the only instance of christmas in the whole album, even though the crew’s presuuuumably been together for multiple years? hm actually maybe that warrants investigation; it’s at *least* the only year Basil has the camera.

      Aubrey Has Become Catholic? guilt, maybe; there’s meta about like, she feels responsible for Mari’s suicide for burdening/troubling her or something, like Survivor Guilt Plus, but *ehh* I don’t think there’s strong evidence for that in-game, it’s an extrapolation that doesn’t *not* make sense but I won’t weigh that too much.  
      maybe more relevantly—religion is *supposed* to be something that comforts people, but it doesn’t. *that* can induce guilt!
      
      also, potential… counterpoint? or at least related: angels. bw-mari ascends like one, bringing to mind that recurring flower motif; there’s literally a character named Angel who parallels Sunny (overbearing older sister—who has a bow, yet,<span class="eta">[\*]</span> to the point where I’ve seen people think the drawing of her in Angel’s notebook (hey! they’re both artists!) is aubrey—but angel seems to admire aubrey/want her approval, showing off his moves and such. Very Different), and there’s an angel foe in hikikomori but idk anything about it I’ve just seen the sprite in ost videos in passing.  
      religion bad, angels good?? fallen angel motif might be related, what with all the vertical theming and that entire apple/sin/sacrifice(!!) scene
    note: |-
      \* Side note, I'm pretty sure the Doylist explanation for this is that both Aubrey and the artist character are based on [Omocat herself](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/59713785775).

      OH did I mention. angels in snow + it means everything motif --> that chord progression is actually signaling church/religion, not so much aubrey herself? that... makes sense I think, her first theme has *none* of it. she just gets uhhhh distorted noisy metal 8,)  
      ...actually, regardless, does anyone besides her and mari even *have* a musical motif? arguably omori's (and by extension sunny's?) is white/black space, the duet is a thing, but point is idk if kel or hero have motifs. i don't think they do... :thonk:
    note: |-
      Honestly, considering the uncertainty here wrt "It Means Everything"'s motif, I wouldn't even say Aubrey has a theme; it's just Mari and "By Your Side." (The tierlist videos suggest Aubrey's motif is the "Lost at a Sleepover"/"Treehouse" theme, but I think that's more connected to the location than her specifically. Heavy ties there, mind, but that's for a later ramble...)

      Last Resort under construction (deepest part, closest to black space) & feels underdeveloped —> Sunny was actively developing it, pushing Black Space further down/away? sort of iterative/repeated development, it makes sense in that context imo… although it falters wrt Humphrey and the general idea of “this <em class="omo noi">will</em> be your last stop before restart.” still, gotta be *something* to the construction…  
      (also very curious that the construction mirrors the treehouse; we have once again the vertical theme, linked more clearly via “treehouse area” (construction in the lake/clouds, iirc?). the treehouse was very much finished, but implicitly that was their last summer together… even the “escape”, home away from home (but not as foreign as orange oasis), couldn’t realize its potential?

      Basil’s “that’s mean! that’s so mean!” is one of two lines that stuck out to me as sounding really young—the other being “if you want a bully(? might be misremembering the first bit), then I’ll *be* a bully!”. both lines yelled in distress and preceding an attack, a reversion to a childish mindset… granted the bully thing might be that idk if people use that past, idk, grade school psas. but Still.

      This was preceded by some kind of tweet involving Aubrey and Basil but it got lost at some point, RIP.
      
      Also, phrasing clarification: 'Granted, maybe Aubrey uses the bully line to mock Kel, because I don't know if anyone uses the word 'bully' sincerely outside, like, grade school PSAs.' Which, eh, it doesn't *not* work but it might be a reach.
