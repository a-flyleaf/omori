      thinkin about the lake scene again.  
      - <em class="omo">Did Basil leave the Egret flower tho.</em>!!! there’s one in <em class="omo noi">his</em> house, very prominently, and one by the picnic basket! and another at the grave; who knows if he’s visited, not me (yet)!! fuck?!!! (Aubrey wouldn’t have left it surely, not if she hasn’t told the Hooligans anything….)
    note: |-
      In retrospect I think this is one of those details that doesn't need a diegetic explanation. Also, the name "Hooligans" is only used in the battle overlay, never by any of the characters, so at this point I tend to think that's just Sunny's insert.

      *Eh,* I no longer think the Headspace kids are meant to have specific ages. They seem especially young at the start, though, so there's still merit to this....

      apparently the sprout mole village song samples this <https://piped.video/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8>; firstly <em class="omo noi">ohhh</em> that skibidi song is *definitely* referencing it, second from the top  comment:
      > I know it’s sort of a joke song, but Scatman John actually had a pretty inspirational life. **He was born with a stutter that made him too nervous to sing, so he played piano for most of his career.** It was only in his 50s that he decided to become a scat performer and made this song as a way to inspire kids with stutters. It made him a worldwide hit, (especially in Japan for some reason) and he did two more notable songs before he died of lung cancer a few years later at 57. He was completely at peace when he passed, declaring:
      >
      > ‘Whatever God wants is fine by me ... I've had the very best life. I have tasted beauty.’ 
      >
      > Scatman John. Legend.

      YouTube comment algorithm sucks, as does the inability to link specific comments... the quote is by YT user @ferghalicious1480. [Skibidi song](https://piped.video/watch?v=ceE_TKZhOwc) unrelated.

      more sobering: Mari’s not wearing the recital outfit, *it’s the one from when she saved Sunny from drowning. they’re not the same.* (it’s a little hard to tell but the recital dress has a collar, & the skirt is separate in the duet animation)

      random thought wrt Hero’s reaction to the truth: There’s a fucked-up part of him that *wants* to be responsible. He can relate—he *understood* why Mari would’ve done it, if she had. [Kel and Aubrey don’t! They’re not suicidal <em class="omo noi">(thank god)</em> but *Hero* had no comment.] And now he doesn’t even get that?  
      (that could be a fic spark but hmmm. no real further thoughts just a Concept)
      
      later edit re:suicidal thoughts—well, ok, they didn’t get why *mari* did it. the identity of the person in question, and everything they (thought they) knew about her, is A Factor. still Highly doubt kel’s ever considered it, aubrey… less sure, but generally want to say no despite it all.  
      this light is a bit more 8,) on Hero’s part though since it suggests he and Mari were close enough he *would* know she was, or had any sort of tendency in that direction. since they both have chronic perfectionism-itis, Well,,
    note: |-
      The dialogue I'm picking at here is three entire lines from right before the gang revisits the treehouse (entire sequence (and then some) transcribed on [this (very image-heavy) page](https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2043/)):
      > <span class="omo">Kel</span>: "Even after all this time... I-I still don't understand why she would do it.  
      > <span class="omo">Aubrey</span>: "I... I don't think any of us ever will."  
      > <span class="omo">Hero</span> [who's already stepped ahead, and with one of very few instances of his teary talksprite]: "... Hey, guys... Let's... Let's keep going."
      
      That is a *very* cospicuous non-confirmation.

      RIP to him too... geez, haven't watched what *happens* yet (these dialogues happen if you lose to the simulations) but he seems real down about this, Hero's crying sprite almost never shows up \:(

      I'll take "insecurities that are not so much as gestured towards literally anywhere else (that I've yet noticed)" for $500. (Kel, naturally, is just hyped about the whole thing.)

      +also, watching the boss rush vid in general: *ohhhh, the healing sound effect is a Mari Thing,* or at least [her skill](https://piped.video/watch?v=3Wd3jPGxPaA&t=1924) uses it. Hm. it was definitely absent in Black Space but not sure about like, Sweetheart's Castle and other no-Mari heal points?

      Have yet to confirm.

      realizing basil doesn't have any damn flowers in his hospital room except like, two little bouquets in the corner. big F
    note: |-
      The hospital comes up again somewhere else (will be linked when I get to it), but while we're here: I'm really, *really* not sure how literally to take the hospital scenes. Regardless, we get one&nbsp;(1) glimpse into his room and it's a *very* significant cutscene; flowers would be distracting.
      
      Still though. F.
