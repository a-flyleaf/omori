&gt;makes site primarily to house this stuff  
&gt;doesn't save any diddly darn place on the homepage to actually, like, Spotlight It

- <b>[An introduction of some sort.](intropost)</b>  
The who (bit about me), the how (approach to the game & meta in general), the why (why tho).
- <b>[January 12: It's all fun and games...](playground)</b>  
Early impressions.
- <b>[January 12: theoryloss.jpg](not-playground)</b>  
Musings on violence, rabid sprouts, Hero as a concept, and other stuff.
