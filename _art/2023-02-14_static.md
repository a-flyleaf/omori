Started as a random sprite redraw, then went for a more interesting crop (was originally just the bottom right), and then a boatload of layers happened. I really like doing compositions like this :0 Uses snippets from [some](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/0193-945882855) [recent](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/you-don-t-know-947380989) [art](roundup-2023-01) [stuff](omori), if you squint.

Vague spoiler babbling:  
Words cannot do justice to the experience of exploring Black Space for the first time, going in completely blind and having no goddamn clue what to expect. It’s weird; usually the type of ambient droning in most areas turns my brain to mush, and the <i>Yume Nikki</i> OST had mostly similar effects (haven’t played it, probably won’t knowing that, but wanted to check out the tracks anyway after noticing a few similarities)—but something about the Black Space tracks *specifically* scratch an auditory itch, especially the first 3 (including the welcome/hub). Dunno what’s up with that but catch me vibing to a distorted classical whistle at 2am ✌️  
&lt;/ramble&gt;

Anyway, I had sillier doodles in mind for today but those can wait for the roundup I guess V: Head was in a funk and this got finished instead.

A slightly modified version of the sprite redraw can be seen on the widescreen version of [the Black Space area reference page](../black-space).
