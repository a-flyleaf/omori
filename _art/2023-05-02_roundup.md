alternatively titled: every day we move further from canon's light

In which there are character interactions and sometimes I remember Hero exists. Hrvatski snippets are mostly cropped because they, once again, got [their very own page]({%include url.html%}/hrvatski/ostatak-aprila) ;V

- [Mari.]({%include url.html%}/mari)
- There are various sources for the unused Faraway emotions but I am linking [this one specifically](https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2076/) (after Spaceboy) because the caption is great. "Air fryer" comment is from [somewhere else](https://lastvalyrian.tumblr.com/post/659127293895114752), though....
- [ya like lore?](https://piped.video/watch?v=mqDOQzfM5Kc)
- Mari's hair being egg-shaped is *not*(!!) me going Freudian-apeshit, it is apparently one of few bits the crew kept intentionally consistent between character art. (Citation: [artbook interview](https://notabird.site/aspiring_aster/status/1635793726709837824).) Same goes for Aubrey's being an egg*plant*, apparently. I Have Many Questions
- Kel "coping" doodle is from a WIP preview I sent a friend of [this thing]({%include url.html%}/art/au-thing)
- [Furious.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/017/734/7dd.jpg) ([I guess!!!](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-guess-guy))
- [spiderman pizza ost](https://piped.video/watch?v=czTksCF6X8Y).
- <i class="omo">Off</i> fanart that I might blatantly rip off is [this lovely thing](https://annoyingdogsprite.tumblr.com/post/182427451377/kr0x-the-frames-to-this-post) (static version linked, original gif isn't flashy but it's a lot of very different frames displayed in rapid succession). It, in turn, is apparently riffing off [an anime intro](https://piped.video/watch?v=Xx_SglPkbFQ)! No sarcasm, isn't the creative cycle great?
- [Omori (Omori)]({%include url.html%}/omori)
- [Omocat art... wow....](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/KEL?file=Omori_Doodles.png)
- "throwback to January" references that particular doodle being from [the first <i class="omo">Omori</i> roundup](roundup-2023-01). Made it marginally neater for use as my YouTube icon.
- Fun fact, the "this side up" Kel is based on [an optical illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_effect)! ...I don't think it works with cartoony art, but it's a thing!
- [Dear diary...](https://charlesoberonn.tumblr.com/post/662631493572624384/writing-in-my-diary-using-a-glitter-gel-pen-im/amp)

As a side note <span lang="hr">volim da</span> (I love that), early on, I was like "dang, Headspace seems really underrated in fanwork considering it's over half the game," and now here I am a third of the year in (?!?????) and I drew the titular guy (not Sunny) like, Once this month and only barely. Like, <span lang="hr">ima *smisla*</span> (â‰ˆit makes sense) that The Real Deal is where it's at, but still.

<!--[there's some additional stuff I forgot (writing notes, meme-dead basils from the hrvatski comic) but I'll shoehorn those into next round]-->
