- [the <i lang="hr">hrvatski</i> train chugs along]({%include url.html%}/hrvatski/itd)
- Part of the Omocat stream [has been uploaded publically](https://piped.video/watch?v=9Wt_OXT2B0w)! It's not the full thing (there was a short interview prior, Q&A after) but this contains the parts I was yelling about---what shaped the characters, namely, and confirmation that symbolism is Importantâ„¢.
- "it's birth imagery" is ripped off a <i>Fullmetal&nbsp;Alchemist</i> manga ?meme-panel-edit, which I thought was a ??meme but *apparently not because I cannot track it down again for the life of me.* It was almost definitely somewhere on [this lovely blog](https://mmmmalo.tumblr.com/), though.
- "old Basil art" isn't referring to any specific piece, but like... [look at it](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/BASIL#ARTWORK)
- [redraw ig](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/66011242193/characters-from-my-game-in-process-omori-%E3%81%B2%E3%81%8D%E3%81%93%E3%82%82%E3%82%8A)
- forgot to note on-canvas but the style used in the "<span lang="hr">prozor duhu</span>" and "unrelated scribbling" canvases is based on some of Omocat's stream art (nothing specific, just that blacked-out default brush scribbling)
- [<b>fun w/ photobashing</b> (standalone upload with credits)](august-water)
- [vaguely-used reference photo for the kids roughhousing](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/three-wrestling-boys-royalty-free-image/185082769) (Basil's body slam just loosely collages various poses from image search results)
- [is this sunflower](https://brother-genitivi.tumblr.com/post/701521053773676545/ot3-i-collect-images-with-powerful-ot3third)
	- normally I try not to show external images in these but here the sketches were drawn right over the references, so
- [no wait *this* is sunflower](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-silent-protector)
	- I have definitely seen this meme redrawn with Sunny and Basil(? or Stranger) wholesale but do not remember who did it, RIP
- [dog with the cheetahs etc.](https://www.tumblr.com/katieaki/709457611082416128/couples-t-shirt-idea)

i take writing very seriously.

Hikikomori playthrough is already underway, notes are being taken with zero regard for prelude or context, [have fun if you wanna~?]({%include url.html%}/meta#hk)
