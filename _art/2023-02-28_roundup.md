[Roundup](roundup-2023-01) the second, in which <i class="omo">Omori</i> is basically the only thing I draw this month. Construction of this site began on the 20th, and is effectively done as of today <span class="display:inline-block;">\o/</span>

I might have added that little zoomed-in Mari silhouette for the sole purpose of being able to use it as a thumbnail here, yes. (Spittake Aubrey was a close contender, though.)

The homepage design will probably change, as noted, but for now the screenshot immortalizes how it appears at site launch. Hooray ðŸŽ‰
