Frankly I just don't want to shoehorn this behemoth into a roundup.

For crumbs of context and actual translation notes, see [the <span lang="hr">hrvatski</span> page]({%include url.html%}/hrvatski/tr). Since the typed text breaks up the panel flow, this exists for quicker reading, as god and anime intended.
