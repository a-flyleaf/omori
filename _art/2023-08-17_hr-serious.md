Doesn't have a title. Date is somewhat fudged; started this on August 11th, worked nonconsecutively til the 22nd, and fixed things on the 24th. Fullsize is upscaled 150% just because.

Unlike the last two Croatian comics that made it to the art page ([uno](hr-tr), [dos](hr-yaoi)) I do not think this will make even a lick of sense if you only know English, but! *oh well!!* (Considered rewriting it but it'd shuffle some speech bubbles around a bit and thus throw off the pacing so *nah.*) Thus, as before, see **[the <span lang="hr">hrvatski</span> page]({%include url.html%}/hrvatski/lake)** for the English translation & related footnotes.
