[🎉](https://notabird.site/OMORI_GAME/status/1362572854793887748)

There were a couple things I loosely considered having done for today, and a whole pile of other ideas, but in the name of not overwhelming myself I went for a redraw of [one of my favorite Omocat arts](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/648910369817018368/aubergine) :3

Weird as hell drawing in my usual style here, and by "here" I mean the face because I'm getting a little too used to that smoother anime "snout." (And in general I paid more attention to anatomy and the details are less simplified, but that's usually the case for any bigger drawing.) Winged the jacket design, based more on [this Omocat merch](https://www.omocat-shop.com/collections/jackets/products/hooligans-bomber-jacket) than the actual art because why not, and slapped on some texture too ~~because I made the lines too clean to capture the rougher feel of the original~~ only to nuke the opacity, as one does.

(P.S. This is transparent! If you're savvy with the element inspector, the rest of the palette looks neat too IMO my onion: <code><span id="pr">#4700C4</span> <span id="pn">#F116FD</span> <span id="b">#0043FF</span> <span id="idk">#6F0068</span></code>; even <code id="y">#FFCE00</code> if you wanna go *really* blind)

been having a normal one, yeah)
