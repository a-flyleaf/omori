  Coupl'a Aubreys, one CMYK fullbody and a sketchy closeup on the face. She's not too happy, dragging the baseball bat with one hand and wiping her face with the other.

From [the deviantArt description](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/smad-mdp-952636937):
<blockquote class="da" markdown="1">
Random doodle that I liked but I didnâ€™t feel like doing a clean fullbody or a background so this composition happened instead <span style="display:inline-block">Â¯\\\_(&nbsp;:V&nbsp;)_/Â¯</span> Static shading was an afterthought but layer effects are fun and all that jazz.

Itâ€™s weird drawing a baseball bat thatâ€™s not an intentionally-lopsided bottle-thing, ngl. Still exaggerated the width a bit too much, whoopsâ€¦.


<br>Time taken: &gt;3 hours, probably closer to 3.5 but it was on and off

+wildly unrelated songs that I had alternating on repeat the whole time: [uno](https://piped.video/watch?v=PV8V84GIVxI) + [dos](https://piped.video/watch?v=7rkE90r9XsY)

I love Aubrey's Faraway design a lot but every other thing about it (and her, in general) causes me intense pain ðŸ™ƒ
