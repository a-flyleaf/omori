Since 2021 I've been ending every month with these big "roundup" files, which put together sketches and other doodles I didn't feel like uploading separately. This one was made entirely before I finished the game, and as you can see it didn't take long for the obsession to set in :D

From [the deviantArt description](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-2023-01-artspace-idek-947911431):

I put this together yesterday but then didn’t get around to posting it because I wanted to keep playing 🤪 Starting to understand why the ending gives people depression! and I’m not even fully there yet!!!!!!

So so SO glad I bought this for myself as a birthday gift, it has taken over my entire thoughts and life and everything and I regret ABSOLUTELY N O T H I N G. Shout-out also to the friend mentioned here, who first recommended the game to me last year & who’s accompanied nearly my entire playthrough! We have put together WALLS of meta and at some point I think I’d like to review & compile it all >:3c But that’s getting ahead of myself. So close, though….

Not much to link here since it’s mostly referencing the actual game, but still:

- here go buy it don’t look at a SINGLE other thing here until you do thanks bye
- That One Crossover brought to you by the other surreal media that took over my brain for a while. If you’re a fan of that (or at all curious tbh, spoilers aren’t really a concept with it I don’t think), check out the trailer if you haven’t already, it looks like a TRIP
- fullbody lineups referenced from this official art

0/10 worst game actually, turns you into a shut-in obsessed with a fantasy world and thus defeats its own entire message smh. See y’all later, if you need me I’ll be clawing out of the void ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
