    - title: <i class="omo">Omori</i> monthly roundup — January 2023 (here there be spoilers!)
    - You can tell more or less how far along I am/was by some of these...<em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">highly</em> recommend going in unspoiled so **this is your last warning** [long thin smiley face with sweatdrop]
    - first Omori doodle: Mii-ass eyes. from memory...
    - minicomic: "Oh no! We have to find Basil!" → <em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">No rush tho.</em> (idr [Hero's] hair...)
      - there is an upside-down smiley face pointing at this
    - minicomic: ah! now I understand phone anxiety. [first panel, repeated in the background:] <em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">no voicemail no voicemail no voicemail no voicemail[...]</em>; [second panel] omg bnnuy, [Leafie says] "commit murder."
    - first row margins:
      - pencil-textured scribbles: don't mind me messing [with] the brush whlie I'm here
      - King Crawler: fucked up and evil &lt;3
      - bunnies: why have rabbits been a minor Thing with me for like. since 2020-ish....

    - Spaceboy minicomic:
      - [kids are] enacting violence. <strong style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;">"Rraaaghh I'm gonna kill you kids"</strong>
      - "Would anyone like some cookies?" ([Hero is] helping). Spaceboy gets a <em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">bonk</em>, Omori noms on his arm
    - Mari: <i>so glad my brother and his friends are having fun~ ♪</i>; [the kids are] clobbering random kid with a kite for absolutely no reason. [Hero:] he is Slow.
    - margin note: <em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">love</em> the way this game makes me experience the entire gamut of human emotion. Discord screenshot: "Aubrey has pink hair and a baseball bat?? I don't know if I trust her but I'm looking forward to that upgrade"; captioned <strong style="text-transform:uppercase;">Me. A <em>fool</em>. Went from "haha cool vibe" to [with distress] <em style="text-transform:uppercase;">Learning.</em>
    
    ----
    
    - Kel, [finger tap meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/roll-safe): don't have to be upset if you refuse to let yourself process Literally Anything Upsetting!!!
    - Basil dinner minicomic: [Basil is] obviously distressed. Kel: "...", then grabs food like a heathen: "<strong style="text-transform:uppercase;"><em>Well</em> I'm sure he'll be fine</strong>"; Sunny, thinking: <i style="text-transform:uppercase;"><b>Do we know the same Basil?!!!!</b> Oh my god. Oh boy he's probably going to</i> (Kel: "haha silly ol Basil eh Sunny") <i>AAAAA[...]</i> "sunny?"
    - Sunny in the mirror: man i really hope i don't get jumpscared by a hallucinatory specter of my dead sister that would be kind of oh ok it's right behind me. cool cool alright alright alright alright alri; Something: <em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">Hiiiiii bro</em>
    - between that and the next doodle: the imagery in this game is So Fucking Good and there is So Much i wanna draw....
    - train: Here is not home.
    
    ----
    
    - context for this [next one]: finished a battle with everyone sad except Hero who was toast. friend dubbed it "a procession for a piece of toast"
      - Here lies Toast. He was our hero.
    - equippable child.
    - style study-thing, ft. some of my own characters beccause it fit better in a 2x2 layout
      - [my] ~usual style (ft. no one in particular, [and I prefer] 3/r4ths or side views]:
        - defined feature shapes
        - hair & mouth often cartoonish
        - eyes used to have pupils & closed shape, but increasingly vary
      - <i class="omo">Omori</i> sprites
        - very anime but simpler
        - the Mii eye thing
        - big-ish/round ears?
        - dot nose
        - small mouth
        - hair in larger sections
      - nose bridge + placement affect a lot
      - I refuse to compromise on unique features/Not Sameface but can do *some* proportional tweaks, rounding, minor details... +also eyes. +and the black flil-scribbles.
      - no side ref but I see this "snout" in simpler anime sometimes; nose bridge B gone. i also Refuse to flatten it entirely but can def. simplify
      - 3/4ths is a free-for-all ig; not much depth
      - \*should also be noted the circular proportions look *younger* regardless of style
      - no particular characters, just style-testin
       - light shading
       - <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Oh</em> I forgot about the blush-thing, tho not all have that
       - <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Oh</em> the neck area!! black that out (a little)? (or skip like the eye line...)
       - strokes generally follow direction of thing, not too "hidden"
      - [on various OCs:]
        - bad angle choice but she can't Not have the nose
        - Curls... The Anime Weakness (cowards)
        - color goes thru eye---no sclera (might ignore this too)
        - is this [young-looking guy] Not just canon.
        - ok Some point allowed. mostly for hair
        - <i class="omo">Omori</i> doesn't do the eyes-thru-hair thing but I elect to ignore that for clarity
        - [different fellow] young....
    - doodle cluster on one canvas:
      - Aubrey headshot: didn't play today but Have to draw my girl at least once... weh
      - eggplant: aubergine....
      - Headspace!Aubrey: "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Drama! Passion! Heartbreak!!!</em>"
      - Omori: <span class="omo">Omori</span>/Sunny (identical)
      - Kel: ---ok idk shapes just goin from memory
      - Hero: (uhh. Hair...) uh. sorry Hero....
      - don't they all have like these Exact bangs... why
      - Kel again: ok this looks too old but <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">ayyy, these eyes</em> [I'd been wanting to use the shape somewhere] + slight chin? for Contast
      - Hero + Kel body shapes: [Hero] pudge, [Kel] athletic
    - margin callout (1 of 2): P.S. apparently a character's way to my heart is like. [middle of a Venn diagram:] A – anger issues; B – guilt issues; C – kind of an asshole [and for all three:] guess who checks these off :^)
    - mini Aubreys:
      - day #346237829...+ of not understanding chibis....
      - GameBoy.
      - tfw they're 90s kids... (?? considering Tamagotchi + no phones even at ~16...)
      - goomba...
    - margin corner: there are lots of weird cutoffs here because early art, as usual, often looks wonky....
    
    ----
    
    - [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeRestoration/comments/wqdx3s/murder_is_okay_template/): "It's okay to ask for help" (Aubrey); "You're not a burden" (Hero); "murder is okay." (Omori); "Your feelings matter" (Kel)
      - margin note: I don't think any of these particularly fit but mostly juts wanted to do Omori with ✨Murder is okay✨
    - some cropped boys: (Hero) "sir ur hair.... (pointy??); Kel: "heh...."; Sunny: "..."
    - margin callout (2 of 2): <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Funny enough</em> Kel hits None Of These but he's like. second favorite.... [pointing at a doodle of older-him and -Aubrey] obsessed with their horseshoe dynamics
      - angry Headspace kids margin doodle: they also do like 90% of Headspace battles. iconic
    - "that's behind me now"---person whose every waking neurosis is shaped by being Extremely Not Over It At All In The Slightest #solidarityHandshake
      - Kel note: "I will simply not even Try to process it"
      - Aubrey note: "I have 'processed' it to dust and it makes me want to explode"

Since 2021 I've been ending every month with these big "roundup" files, which put together sketches and other doodles I didn't feel like uploading separately. This one was made entirely before I finished the game, and as you can see it didn't take long for the obsession to set in :D

From [the deviantArt description](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-2023-01-artspace-idek-947911431):
<blockquote class="da" markdown="1">
I put this together yesterday but then didn’t get around to posting it because I wanted to keep playing 🤪 Starting to understand why the ending gives people depression! and I’m not even fully there yet!!!!!!

So so <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">so</em> glad I bought this for myself as a birthday gift, it has taken over my entire thoughts and life and everything and I regret <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">absolutely <em style="letter-spacing:.5em; margin:0 -.5em 0 .25em">nothing</em></em>. Shout-out also to the friend mentioned here, who first recommended the game to me last year & who’s accompanied nearly my entire playthrough! We have put together <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">walls</em> of meta and at some point I think I’d like to review & compile it all >:3c But that’s getting ahead of myself. *So close, though….*

Not much to link here since it’s mostly referencing the actual game, but still:

- [here go buy it](https://www.omori-game.com/en) don’t look at a <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">single</em> other thing here until you do thanks bye
- That One Crossover brought to you by [the *other* surreal media that took over my brain for a while](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23ena). If you’re a fan of that (or at all curious tbh, spoilers aren’t really a concept with it I don’t think), [check out the trailer](https://piped.video/watch?v=qLurAhsqXWc) if you haven’t already, it looks like a TRIP
- fullbody lineups referenced from [this official art](https://notabird.site/OMORI_GAME/status/1542759335859613696)

0/10 worst game actually, turns you into a shut-in obsessed with a fantasy world and thus defeats its own entire message smh. See y’all later, if you need me I’ll be clawing out of the void ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
