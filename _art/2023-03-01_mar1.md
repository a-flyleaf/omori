From [the deviantArt description](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/--951778977) (but this birthday post link works):

Based on a certain photo. Only nice and wholesome things here. :-)

A bit rushed/plain since I was busy today, but wanted to draw a little something for the occasion~ The lines turned out less “wonky” than they strictly should be, but I guess that fits in a perfectionistic way. Which was definitely intentional. Absolutely.

Time taken: 3.5 hours, almost on the dot. Each frame alone was probably pretty fast, but y’know, animation \o/
