  Redraw of three stages of the Omori boss fight, faded together into one picture. Text is written in the upper and lower margins, but scribbled out.

From [the deviantArt description](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/--948448397):
<blockquote class="da" markdown="1">
<i class="omo">Omori</i>â€™s endgame was devastatingly beautiful but yâ€™know, bittersweet as the ending cutscenes are, I think this is the part thatâ€™s *really* gonna haunt me.

This is three versions in a fading trenchcoat; separate stages + further rambling on sta.sh: <b>major spoiler warning applies</b>

<blockquote class="da" markdown="1" id="altdesc">
there is something <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">about</em> the avatar of escapism turning into the embodiment of raw self-loathing but even then, even after everything, his last action is to offer comfort. because thatâ€™s what heâ€™s always existed to do, and itâ€™s always been a little self-destructive, but four years of festering will warp it beyond recognitionâ€”or, more likely, reveal whatâ€™s been there from the start.

self-hatred is still a defense mechanism, at the end of the day. hurting yourself before anyone else can get to you, as if itâ€™ll build up immunity and not threaten to kill you if left unchecked.

Iâ€™m in pain, dudes.

Took about ~3â€“4 hours, referencing [offcial sprites](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/OMORI_(Enemy)#GALLERY) with a couple extra arm-shapes to fill the space. Had [the distorted theme](https://piped.video/watch?v=bKC8qqqLZ6A) on loop for a majority of it, because I like to suffer, and I still donâ€™t quite hear those voices everyone in the comment section is talking about but still. Visuals alone do not do this game justiceâ€”nor does sound alone, not even (Iâ€™d argue) watching a playthrough, because you donâ€™t *get* those moments Omori isnâ€™t listening to you anymore.

Did not expect him of all characters to make me this goddamn sad. I didnâ€™t want to attack him for a good few rounds. 8(

Anyway, first versionâ€™s background is a flipped+faded version of the texture on the other two, and the wonky text was written with my left hand since [thatâ€™s apparently what Omocat did](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/189112408140/the-two-fonts-in-omori-one-was-written-with-my). And *thatâ€™s it <span style="display:inline-block">thatâ€™s all I got</span>*
