On one hand this didn't take several days to plan out and put together. On the other hand, <i>[dying artblock noises]</i>

- [<i>Friday Night Funkin</i>](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) is a game I was into for a few months ~~last summer~~ wtf do you mean it was 2021. At any rate I definitely would not have considered it a conscious style influence, but *shrug???*

- i need you to source the copypasta. [you will do this for me](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/green-mm-bambi-copypasta)
- There is an unused test file that apparently starts with Mari going <q>^\_^)b</q>. [wow....](https://goats.dev/omori/maptext.html#TEST)
- As with [last round](roundup-2023-06), "stream-inspired" doesn't refer to any particular art. also [that one Basil pose](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/66011242193/characters-from-my-game-in-process-omori-%E3%81%B2%E3%81%8D%E3%81%93%E3%82%82%E3%82%8A) shows up again, and the "unsolicited fuckening creacher" is pasted straight from a margin doodle.
- [waka?](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/BASIL#TRIVIA) [waka....](https://piped.video/watch?v=6Ue-HZuzsM8&t=18)
- The incredibly loose Kate&nbsp;Beaton "inspiration" draws (pun not intended) from her work in [the graphic memoir <i>Ducks</i>](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/ducks/). It is the most *tenuous* connection, preceded by some non-fanart busts that probably show the inspiration better, but those aren't shown here so :V
