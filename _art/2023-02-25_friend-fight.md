. . . This was supposed to be a quick doodle \o\"/

Pain and Agony™ over this whole shebang being console-exclusive, smh >:V Oh well, have a [sprite redraw](https://piped.video/watch?v=YA6KwX5ogEw) of sorts that got out of hand; mostly just wanted to draw the kids, winged the rest! Having a lot of fun with the style mishmash, thiiink I’m finding a way I like to do it….

Time taken: 4 hours and then some (ah, “as soon as I export the png I find fifty things to tweak”-itis), and about half was messing around with the colors & textures. A+ use of an evening!
