  A collection of Basils and his associated flowers. A large Basil to the left is shaded blue, surrounded by a scribbly Something; the rest of the canvas features brighter drawings: a sunflower, daisy, Basil being nervous, "basil lol" (the plant); [battle sprite](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/BASIL#BATTLE_SPRITES) redraws (ecstatic/manic, furious, and afraid), with a silhouetted Stranger near the latter; and finally, in the lower right corner, Basil gives a big ol' thumbs-up with the caption "We did it!"

This dude’s not even my favorite but I felt like doing a doodle page of one of the kids and it's his [special day](https://notabird.site/OMORI_GAME/status/1362572854793887748) today, so <span style="display:inline-block;">¯\\\_( ᐛ )_/¯</span> Happy(?) birthday to the fucked-up little plant dude!

Lots of mixed thoughts on this guy (he was one of my least favorites (more indifference than active dislike) when I was nearing the endgame, haven’t put together thoughts on the six since) but I’ve been starting to like him more, between his main plot role being *knocked out of the fucking park* and assorted meta-binging. Special shout-out to [this (spoilery, ofc) post](https://lastvalyrian.tumblr.com/post/679553318216925184/basils-flower-is-the-daisy-not-the-sunflower) for clarifying a fun little detail ;V

Anyway, style copytheft is fun and all, but i Have to have a margin between the eyes and the sides of the face or i’ll die. In all seriousness if he looks like an OC of mine the answer is Yes, and shout-out to [this post also](https://lastvalyrian.tumblr.com/post/684631582526537728) for describing the vibe I was going for o7 (← that’s a salute)

edit: <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Whoops</em> forgot a bit in the upper right corner (no wonder the composition looked off…), not sure if I’ll go back and add it but for the record: “Everything is going to be okay…” but violently scribbled out and underneath is scrawled “<span class="omo">this shit sucks.</span>” send tweet

I do not feel like editing that in because I drew entirely in its absence, but [for the record](roundup-2023-02), that's the vibe.
