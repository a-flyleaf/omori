i'll take "art that is weird/tricky to make a thumbnail of" for $143,

Random ~55-minute thing because my tablet is covered in rust. The face (er, quote-unquote "face") was an afterthought but the pose & colors turned out more or less as imagined, which doesn't happen often \o/

+dramatic floaty pose idea sparked by [someone else's fanart](https://www.tumblr.com/udeta/710919038081155072/%E6%9C%80%E8%BF%91%E3%81%AE%E7%B5%B5)
