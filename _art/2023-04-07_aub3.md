  Three versions of Aubrey: canon, fanon, and "your design" (in my usual style).

I typed up this whole big cross-site description in advance except now putting it all here without the deviantArt-styled quotebox feels too casual?? Heck it, it's getting published here first but I'm sticking this in a dA blockquote anyway:

<blockquote class="da" markdown="1">
Didn’t plan on going the whole nine yards with color and everything here but ᕕ(&nbsp;ᐛ&nbsp;)ᕗ

Saw [this version](https://www.deviantart.com/gloomyteeth/art/Canon-vs-Fanon-trend-956812908) on my front page today (TIL <i>Goosebumps</i> fanon real??), artist actually linked [the source](https://notabird.site/SunnyDionysus/status/1638988357286916096), went 👀👀👀

<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Fanon version is not derogatory</em>, to be 500% clear!! Fanon gonna fanon and people want Undyne&nbsp;2, that one face gives off the vibe, I can get that (and I really cba to get mad about people’s character interpretations anymore); I actually had a lot of fun going ham on the exaggeration! (Can someone explain the “slap on bandaids everywhere” aesthetic, though?) Ironically this is more the character I <em>thought</em> I was going to get, too—I just got my heart pummeled into dirt instead 😄

It’s kind of a wild change of pace, tbh, <em>not</em> wanting to go all My City Now on the source material (er, silly joke doodles notwithstanding). Actual canonical character development will do that!

+additional indulgent Aubrey rambles:  
Essentially something I try to keep in mind is that, despite the ">:D haha yeah we're gonna beat you up" face being decidedly canonical, *that's a front.* Aubrey spends like 2/3rds of her Faraway screentime wanting you to go away, and in the remaining third I'm like 85% sure that expression only shows up again when she's 1)&nbsp;talking to Kim and 2)&nbsp;telling Sunny to "break a leg" (word choice,,,,) in the buildup to the Omori fight, which isn't even Actually her.

I probaby do ignore that side too much sometimes, she did very much backtalk a priest, but in a *majority* of [official art](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/AUBREY#ARTWORK) her expression is just so goddamn *flat*... my go-to attitude for her is a lot more "aloof, or trying to be" than "<i class="omo">c'mon bro let's start swingin</i>'."

Anyway, I keep wanting to do [this one fandom template-meme-thing comparing the actual cast portraits to how the artist draws them](https://notabird.site/heyitspegkat/status/1638785959452897282), but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ maybe some other day. For now I saw an A+ excuse to draw The Favorite™ and ran with it \o/

<div id="end" markdown="1">
Time taken: 5 hours, over a couple sessions  

Referenced [a very specific art](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/AUBREY?file=Aubrey_intro.png) for the "canon" version, and nothing in particular for fanon but <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/mozzaremi/682400492510461952/auby-scale-where-does-your-auby-fall-under">this post</a> pretty much defines my impression (hence the pose shift).
</div></blockquote>

+bonus, if you wanted to see That Face in my usual style:
<img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/misc/clearly.png" alt="i am Haunted by this one post that calls this expression “clearly you don’t own an air fryer.” shout-out to unused Faraway emotions…"/>
Full canvas will be in a roundup as usual. For now, [air fryer memes](https://lastvalyrian.tumblr.com/post/659127293895114752).
