Hi, I put this together on May&nbsp;28th. I'm making the actual page for it on June&nbsp;1. In the long run that is an entirely negligible difference, but for now, *yells*

- That <b>[headshot wall](headshots)</b> took a very long time even though it looks very simple. The process side-by-side like that might not be as effective as a gif but *eh!* It's there.
- Kel rocks [high heels](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/HIGH_HEELS), it's practically canon (at least in Sunny's head) (but lbr he *would*)
- when you go to draw an outfit swap but they're all in the [same outfit](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spider-man-pointing-at-spider-man)
- scrapped panels from the <b>[lake comic](hr-serious)</b>
- unfortunately [the vibe](https://lastvalyrian.tumblr.com/post/704017626059440128)
- and last but certainly not least, [<i lang="hr">novu stranicu</i>]({%include url.html%}/hrvatski/prijateljstvo)
