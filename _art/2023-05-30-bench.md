  In which Kel, Aubrey, and Basil chill on a bench. In the main drawing Kel pulls his friends closer, which garners varying degrees of flusterment; in a bonus comic, Sunny walks in on the scene, and joins in his own way.

    - <b>"Oh hey, Sunny!"</b> Kel greets. In a continuation of the main drawing's action, Aubrey is shoving him back and Basil is kinda slumped, having been pulled closer; both pause to look over at Sunny.
    - In a black bar resembling the game flavor text (implicitly Sunny's thoughts): "<b>There is no room for yo</b>u;" the end is cut off by Kel's dialogue: <b>"The more the---<em class="omo">ow</em>---the merrier~!"</b> (Aubrey has stomped on his foot. Basil meanwhile shuffles upright.)
    - Sunny stares. There's really not that much room. Basil pats the bench at his side in an invitation.
    - So Sunny seats himself in Kel's lap, much to the trio's amusement. <b>"**All right!!**"</b> Kel exclaims, <b>"That works...!!"</b> (Sunny is content.)

Noticed [last month](roundup-2023-04) that "just chilling on a bench" was an unintentional little go-to. ([<i>Peanuts</i> wall](https://peanuts.fandom.com/wiki/Brick_wall), anyone?) Felt like drawing the post-truth triad. This spawned ᕕ(&nbsp;ᐛ&nbsp;)ᕗ ~~<i>Never make me draw a bench ever agai---</i>~~

Background is roughly frankenstein'd from two photos ([main](https://unsplash.com/photos/HlhgXw-1r8A) + [foreground](https://unsplash.com/photos/lGc6zidgEns)); outfits more or less ripped from [some merch promo art](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/646768822762848257/the-omori-collection-is-available-now-some). Did you know there's an old <i class="omo">Omori</i> teaser sketch called "[the love bench](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/37324346177/omori-teaser-the-love-bench)"? Wasn't an intentional reference but I thought that was funny.

Time taken: 8h25m for the main drawing + 5h15m for the bonus, all in 3&nbsp;days. Yeah, I don't know how the bonus took that long either; multiple fullbodies on a relatively big canvas will do that....
