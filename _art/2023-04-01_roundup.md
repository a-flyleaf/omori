Third month in a row in which I am reletlessly obsessed with <i class="omo">Omori</i>, this time featuring copious amounts of the side characters. 

Uploading it here first for a change, because I "censored" some of the morbid bits for the deviantArt upload<!--link--> and also I need to use my site first more often in general. That said, linkstuffs:

- standalone art that got done this month: a [Mar1](mar1) and an [Aubey](smad)
- <b>[Heardle.]({%include url.html%})</b>
- [We've made a Hero that screams (on the inside)!](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ive-made-a-robot-that-screams)
- Kel says: [<span class="omo">Kill</span>](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/snapchat-kill-guy)
- eye closeup-bust-things inspired by [whatever <i>Persona</i>'s got going on here](https://caterpie.tumblr.com/post/94579145947) (assuming that's not fanart)
- [cringe is dead](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shreks-cringe-compilation)
- [This Kel birthday post](https://notabird.site/OMORI_GAME/status/1458706061469237251) is a neat handwriting reference. "you know who this is"... "dumbutt"....
- [The <i class="omo">Omori</i> Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/omocat/omori) is a hell of a thing in retrospect. Could you *imagine* changing the party's names??
- [Quieres?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/quieres)
- [my best buddy chum pal](https://annoyingdogsprite.tumblr.com/post/131886235407/you-guys-ask-for-it-quality-sans-from-utg)
- [Go here. Go in the dark.](https://sirenspells.tumblr.com/post/662905409181483008/hey-again-i-didnt-mean-for-all-of-them-to-be)
- There's no official source for the old concept ?photo from the artbook (far as I've found so far), but I sniped it from [this actual-photo gallery of the book's new stuff](https://notabird.site/aspiring_aster/status/1635793726709837824). Wish it had more behind-the-scenes, but hey! Chibi dead-Mari, who doesn't want that.
- "Fuck it we ball" idea stolen from [a Choice tumblr tag](https://sirenspells.tumblr.com/post/712354324746010624)
- Tidbit with pigtails!Omori and Aubrey is from [an old website... background? GIF??](https://old.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/orpk6q/omori_old_websites_backgrounds/)
- Genderbent designs and "Rowan" are all (more or less referenced) from "official" art: [2014 pixel drafts](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/184424886265/very-first-pixel-drafts-of-the-omori-cast-a-lot) and [a 2012 teaser](https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/37325412044/omori-teaser-rowan)
- <b>[Croatian is a Concept!]({%include url.html%}/hrvatski)</b>
- [the dog they put with the cheetahs to stop them from going crazy](https://www.tumblr.com/katieaki/709457611082416128/couples-t-shirt-idea)
- I think about [this *other* Kel birthday art](https://notabird.site/OMORI_GAME/status/1458708574037848069), and the fact Mari died only about a month before, a lot.

Did you know FireAlpaca has a maximum image dimension (in either direction) of 20,000 pixels? The full size of this file is 20,000 pixels tall.
