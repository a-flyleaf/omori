Been a hot minute since I sat back and enjoyed some old animator favorites\*, made me want to do my own animation again \o/ I've been meaning to practice hair animation for ages, and although this turned out a lil choppy and the expression change is extreme for the framerate, I'm happy with it overall! Also, who let Aubrey's design have a billion loose parts!!

Time taken: ~4 hours, split about half for lines and half for everything else.
