  "Eternal banana": in which Mari holds a banana like a phone and makes goofy faces about it. Also noted on the canvas: (pointing at a yelling gesture) "(<em class="omo">Infernal</em> banana?)" & "awkward stock photos FTW."

This waaaaas supposed to be a warmup <span style="display:inline-block;">ᕕ(&nbsp;ᐛ&nbsp;)ᕗ</span>

I do not particularly understand why Mari [is associated with the random banana](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/MARI?file=Mari_Sticker_%28Eternal_Banana%29.png#STICKERS) but I think it's funny. I also seem to be more or less incapable of drawing her in a way that doesn't either make her a doof or lean into the horror show, but I'm having fun.
