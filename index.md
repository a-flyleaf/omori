<span>Fansite for the game <a href="https://www.omori-game.com/en/"><i class="omo">Omori</i></a>.</span> <span>**Here there be spoilers.**</span> <span>Same content warnings as the actual game apply.</span>

[The sitemaker](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/) *strongly* recommends you play through the game at least once, ideally unspoiled as possible, before diving into fan content---which is what this site was created to house. Yes, it's taken over my life a little. I had to put it *somewhere*.
