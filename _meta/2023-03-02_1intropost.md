Howdy ðŸ‘‹ I'm assuming you got here through [the about page]({%include url.html%}/about), which (at the time of writing) serves as an intro to yours truly and some various <span class="omo">Omori</span>-related factoids. Also at the time of writing, I've been working on this site for about a week and a half, launched it a couple days ago, and it's about time I start using it for its originally-intended purpose: compiling the boatloads of [meta](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Meta) I've accumulated over the last few weeks of being obsessed with this game!

Some things to know, going in:

## playthrough notes
- I've played through the entire game once, mostly blind, and "liveblogged" a majority by sharing it in Discord direct messages with my good friend Weeb. He gave me a few small pointers, mostly pertaining to missable content (that Recycultist sidequest, man) but it was by no means a 100% run. For instance, I was nudged towards watering Basil's flowers daily, but apparently missed it somewhere because I didn't get that bonus scene at the end.
- Reviewing that "liveblog" is going to be my primary meta-project here, putting various observations/thoughts/opinions/etc. together in a more digestible format.

<blockquote class="dc" markdown="1">
Occasionally I may see it fit to share snippets directly from Discord; they'll be quoted like this. This may include screenshots, linked directly without reupload; Discord can be finicky about image-linking, so in case they don't load for whatever reason, alt text is provided.
</blockquote>

- Immediately after finishing the first playthrough, I threw the spoiler blinds to the wind. That said, I'm waiting to play the other routes (namely "Hikikomori" (not answering Kel)), and generally go through the game on a 100% achievement hunt, until *after* I finish this liveblog-compilation.

Prior to playing, I knew basically fuckall about <i class="omo">Omori</i>; about a year earlier, Weeb had recommended it and an artist I follow had made fanart, but neither told me much of anything about what it was *about*. I bought the game for myself on Steam as a birthday gift, played daily for like six days straight, and then on-and-off as my and Weeb's schedules aligned. Took about a month in all, with over 70 hours logged on my last save file, and I don't remember if there was an exact point I went from indifferent to head-over-heels "oh, this is going to consume my every waking thought now" adoration, but it happened *early*.

## bias, inevitably
- My favorite characters are Aubrey and Kel, because I think they are fun and they cause me emotional pain. Objectively, though, I think Sunny is the most well-developed character, and I *try* not to let my character preferences skew my analysis.
- From what I've discerned, the game takes place in the late 90s/early aughts, and I'm old enough to be vaguely familiar with the latter part of that timeframe. *Vaguely.*
- I am fascinated by the narrative/storytelling approach that develops everything around a certain idea or arc, prioritizing symbol over realism. I don't know if there's a name for this, storytelling is not a "realistic vs figurative" binary, but here's some formative influnces on my thinking:
	- ["Psychological Storytelling" by mmmmalo on Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20481008)---<i>Homestuck</i> meta, but the driving ideas apply: "thoughts, feelings, and desires may find expression in the environment, in the medium of the story itself, and in the form of other characters." (I mean. *Headspace?* Hello??) mmmmalo knows a hell of a lot more about Freudian psychology than I strictly care to, but I've taken a few pointers from these trains of thought, especially concerning visual parallels & the idea of a character's neuroses being manifested in how the story is built.
	- ["Annihilation and Decoding Metaphor" by Folding Ideas on YouTube (linked via Piped)](https://piped.video/watch?v=URo66iLNEZw)---Fun fact, I have not actually watched this movie! I read the book and it's not *terribly* similar (but very good in its own right). That said, this is perfectly digestible to someone unfamiliar with the source material (the analysis above, probably less so); A+ exploration of how metaphor points at theme, with much less talk of the subconsciousness.
	- <i>How to Read Literature Like a Professor</i> by Thomas C. Foster---This is an actual book; PDFs are not hard to find (;V). Where the video uses a specific movie to make its point, this book uses a wide assortment of sources to make its points; it's an introduction to dissecting novels with an eye for common symbology, with most chapters dedicated towards a particular motif. While it acknowledges that, say, winter need not always mean death, it's still nice to have a roadmap of sorts.
- All that established, I love me a good in-universe analysis (why did character do that? what's their favorite color, where'd they go to school), but I increasingly find my thoughts on <i class="omo">Omori</i> skewing [Doylist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist). Why was the decision made to tell the story like this, and not that? Why this design choice? Wouldn't it have been easier to do XYZ instead of ZYX? Character-level meta and storybuilding-level meta approaches can and probably will flip on a dime.

Yes, sometimes the squint-between-the-lines lenses lead me to absolutely batshit places (I spent a good chunk of the early game thinking Mari was Omori's mother; I still think Sunny saw her as something of a mother-*figure*). But sometimes it pointed me in potentially-fruitful directions (ah, Something and the noose motifs). And most importantly, it's fucking *fun* to feel like the guy in [the Pepe Silvia meme](https://piped.video/watch?v=1NBfZcNU4O0), actually.

## why tho
Again: Because it's fun, next question.

Less flippantly: Idk, I just like dissecting stories! I like it even more when they're *rewarding*. Prior to <i class="omo">Omori</i> my previous fixations have either been #NotThatDeep, or I just didn't know how or *want* to pick at them so closely, not like this. But I feel like every other thread I've chased with this game has led me *somewhere,* and by and large it's been absurdly rewarding.

I also felt the need to make a site for it because novellas of meta are absolutely obliterating my note-to-self solo-DMs, and I would like to organize them Somewhere Else. IDEK, man. There's A Lot.
