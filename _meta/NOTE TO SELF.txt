just type the thing in a plain .md/.txt doc at first, IGNORE THE FORMATTING AND PICTURES (maybe, *maybe* add an [img] line if deemed necessary. I just don't wanna get caught up feeling like I need to screenshot every other thing; if it happens it happens, if it don't it don't). then copypaste the layout stuff; ONLY thing that should need editing is block/quotes, and sometimes links and *maybe* pictures.
