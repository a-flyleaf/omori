friend is playing, noticing more things... this may or may not get ahead of *my* playthrough but I'll fuss over how to organize noteshit later

## 8/10
- hey man why the fuck does *berly* drop the "my best friend!" line
- nose and bun bickering at the slide. = kel and aubrey?? ~~"you know I can't stay mad at you" lol lmao~~
- absolutely wack that the present is available from the first store (and there's no way you'll be able to buy it). truth already creeping in....
- kel has to nudge the sad sprout mole Blease,,,
- oh fuck if you say you don't admire mari it's an early reveal she's your big sister. I did not catch that!!
	- [8/13] or like, I *did* pick this option this round, but I didn't catch that it was New Information on account of not playing blind anymore. really something to be said for fresh eyes....
- hmm. first boss (who isn't Boss) really has you beat up an old man
- hmmm. stab in the same place as tag. is that anything  
edit: OH YES IT IS--*YOU STOP BEING YOURSELF.* you stop being Omori. you no longer wish to Be.
- THE HANGMAN HINTS ARE A FUCKING POEM I NEVER NOTICED!!!!! (just Barely but there *are* definitely rhymes!!)
- boss, "leave me alone to repent." huh. Huh

## 8/12
- Spaceboyâ€™s room has music to the right and *an invisible/hidden/secret door to the left. to the fuckening JUNKYARD*
- apparently there is a WTF event in the junkyard where the "picture of someone familiar" disappears and makes a spooky sound if you examine it---IF you do so with Omori tagged. I did not get this in either playthrough (although ig I can go back for it now)!!
