No; no, this is not what I would call A&nbsp;Meta at all. But it's going in here because I don't know where else to put it :V <!--should have a new layout later!!-->

Earlier in the month I finally listed out all the gosh dang achievements, with a separate page for the ones I got from the initial playthrough; not linking that page since I'll probably move/delete it at some point, but---aw what the hell:

<details id="ach"><summary id="sum">the entire contents of the page, copypasted as-is</summary><hr><div id="ach-c" markdown="1">
this isn't really supposed to be A Page i just don't know where else to put it

I am a *slight* stickler for archival, yes. There's also a page with [all the achievemnts]({%include url.html%}/achievements), though at the time of writing it's still a heavy WIP; content's there, just bare bones and not organized any better than the Fandom wiki.

Anyway, main reason I'm here is because I just wanna trawl through my save files real quick. I used up all 6 slots somehow and wanna clear those out....

Man, I'm gonna miss Sunny on the title screen when I reset :,)

. . . *update, my memory is ass,* I only used 5. And also there's no way to *delete* saves. Cool, cool. There is no real rhyme or reason to the order here, either!

## File 1: Three days left...
Faraway Park, playtime 17:47:20.

Daytime. Sunny is shit outta juice and also cash. This miiiight have preceded the church scene? Man, if only there was a significant recurring NPC who reminded us what the next available things to do are....

- "Maybe <span class="omo">Basil</span> is in the bathroom or something." Ok, rechecking the [Let's&nbsp;Play](https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2011/): for the record, this precedes the bit where Kel and Sunny have dinner at his place. Which makes me think Basil running off to the bathroom (y'know, to have an anxiety attack) was already an established habit, RIP. 

Oh, *cool fuckin beans,* it is <em class="omo">right</em> at the expected breakpoint (plot-wise, at least, not gonna do the NPC runaround again). Past-me probably thought, after the scene, "man, this is something I might want to revisit, isn't it" and I was right, actually. I keep wanting to redraw this bit as a comic or animatic or something, although the sheer scope of the thing keeps intimidating me out of it.

Anyway!

## File 2: Two days left...
Forest Playground, playtime 69:37:25. Omori is already level 50.

That Is Quite A Jump, yes. I think I used this slot for my main file for *most* of the rest of the game (it's the ending where things get muddled), so I'd wager this is after I finished all the sidequests and have nothing to do but trek onwards to Black&nbsp;Space.

---Yep, we're *right* in front of Mari and the only quest left is "Empty House." Probably gonna hold onto this save anyway, on the off chance I ever want to trawl back around Headspace, which is a thing I've definitely done in the months since beating the game. (Look, I'm not buying RPGMaker just to poke around, it's either LPs/videos or my own saves or bust....)

P.S. killed *128 bunnies.* Ha, cool programming number! (I think? Uh, I don't know the technical details but it comes up a lot with dimensions and color values and such.) Also, whole party was max-level, charmless, and had good weaponry but I *know* they had their defaults for 90% of the game (only switched it out for the Oasis chicken to make sure it got slaughtered in one turn. That Was Not Necessary. I'm gonna try not to overlevel next round...).

## File 3: Two Days Left...
Black Space, playtime 74:10:56.

Not sure where this is, exactly? ---Oh, shit, this is outside the Church of Something. Don't have much else to say or do here; may or may not keep this slot depending how far along the others are, as a "get other endings cheap/free" card. (I was definitely warned to keep a slot *right* before the decision to save Basil, but I think I overwrote it....)

## File 4: ???
Backstage, playtime 83:19:43.

Ah dang, a'ight, already decided to beat the shit out of Basil then. Only way to go is forward (literally; Sunny shakes his head if you try walking down too far), and thennnn... Duet sequence, I think? The ending sequence is so Much it always gets jumbled in my head....

-checks [LP](https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2048/)- *Oh wait no ok,* Omori fight and *then* the Duet. Guess this is a quick ticket to the Oyasumi end, then.... :,D Saving just for that, I suppose.

(As a side note, Crime and Slander that the Fandom wiki doesn't note this area, along with all the other abstract-as-hell maps from the truth sequence, under "Black Space." They're all *incredibly* important and symbolic and such, but they don't get special pages like the rooms found via doors. Heck is up with that!!!)

## File 5: One Day Left...
Faraway Park, 77:48:59.

I have no idea what this one i---*oh my god it's after I beat the fucking Recycultist minidungeon.* Why did I skip a file here, anyway >:V There's no partiiicularly plot-relevant point of interest here, seems like I triggered most of the breaktime dialogues already, and Kel prevents a return to Sunny's house...

---*oh ok* it's Basil check-in time, the gang doesn't even know he's hospitalized. Right, I did things... not *out* of order but it feels like it wasn't strictly intended, with the subsequent dialogue like "well, we've got all day to ourselves; whatcha wanna do, Sunny?" ← Words That Mean Nothing To Someone Who Already Ran Around And Did As Much As Possible.

- God, I've complained about this already (not here just ~somewhere in conversation or personal notes or something), but there really are subtle touches in various cutscenes that you completely miss by either just watching a video (when you lose control of Omori, namely) or reading a transcript (sprite movements! pauses!!). Here's a bit from this scene: After Polly heads back inside, Kel and Sunny (not in tandem but in short order) *immediately* turn to Hero. It's such a *little* thing, basically just emphasizes what we already know (they both look up to him a ton), but still!!
- Anyway, will forever not be over how they phrased this dialogue, the general "last day here" sort of thing, and later "you will really miss them." It's left *completely* ambiguous as to *why* this might be Sunny's last day here....

So, yeah, don't need to keep this file either, but some other tidbits of note while I'm here:

- Wow, flavor text for Kel's Pet&nbsp;Rock is "Kel's best friend." Hector is rock is dog is Rock(TM)<!--the uppercase letters are intentional here-->-rock but *my guy really doesn't* (didn't, I guess) *have a "best" friend anymore, huh.*
	- addendum: Right, right, also bears remembering that flavor text is also filtered through Sunny. Granted, Kel strikes me as a "has many friends but none(/few) are *close*" kind of guy, but it seems Sunny also thinks Kel has no BFFs left but his rock toy. Kind of self-deprecating in that way, on Sunny's part; if he asked, I'd imagine Kel would call him a BFF again in a heartbeat.
- This would've surprised me if I hadn't already seen someone talking about it (somehow did not notice during playthrough, or if I *did* then it didn't stick to memory) but Aubrey already having a charm, the Pinwheel, is a nice touch! Reportedly it also isn't there after she leaves it at the stump. Don't feel like replaying the scene to check that, but I really need to dig into the pinwheel symbolism some time....\*
- Sunny's "weapon" is Hands, "This is all you have." (sounds mildly pathetic/disappointed; yeah, the knife sure has more "cool" factor (but at what cost)...); Hero's is *Fist,* "Gets the job done." They Are The Same Fucking Thing and Sunny is *still* compelled to hold Hero's in higher regard.

<span id="pinwheel">\*</span>Aaand immediately after writing that, jotted down a few thoughts, the more-publicly-comprehensible version of which is essentially: the fans of the pinwheel are to leaves of trees, and the pinwheel is a decidedly happier (or at least more nostalgic) counterpart.

1. A recurring image is of leaves swaying in the breeze (maybe not that exact phrasing but something to the extent);
2. trees are very much memory-related, albeit not the happiest memories;
3. pinwheels, meanwhile, are *definitely* memory-related (colors corresponding to the characters, and subsequent conspicuous placements throughout Faraway), and there's only nice if bittersweet associations here;
4. and also, the pinwheel being *planted* in the stump makes it an artificial outgrowth/stand-in. (uh, "planted" pun not intended. but it totally works.)

Huh, y'know, I used to be kinda irked/confused by the pinwheel's prominence in the thank-you screen (and Aubrey sticking it there at all; it kinda felt like her monopolizing *Sunny's* memory), but maybe I was making the character association line too strong... I mean, that whole character development is a post in its own right (spoiler alert, I still have mixed feelings about it), and there's definitely still a strong association made by that action. But maybe it's more, like, *generally* cementing the memory than anything specific to any one person...? Hmmmm.

----

. . . Anyway, I guess I can actually call this a meta post now, cool :B ~~organization be damned, *do you see these convoluted, twisted, tangent-happy lines in which I think*~~
