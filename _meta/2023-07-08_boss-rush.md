As prompted by Weeb, some quickfire thoughts on [the Headspace bosses](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/ENEMIES#BOSSES).

- <b>Boss</b>™: Exists! A while back I found [a very neat theory which posits that Boss is based on Basil](https://lastvalyrian.tumblr.com/post/671471488011993088/whats-the-deal-with-boss). I like it, I think it has merit! I barely paid attention to this guy in my first playthrough, but I don't think I'll find too much to *dis*agree with here!
- <b>Ye Olde Sprout</b>: Idk! Apparently reappears in Black&nbsp;Space?? I vaguely remember *some* post about the potential significance of that, maybe he was looking at a photo before the gang rudely ~~beat him to death~~ interrupted, but I don't remember either the post or the encounter that well.
- <b>Kite Kid</b>: As touched on [last round](not-meta#pinwheel), there's definitely a symbolic line to be drawn between memories, trees, and pinwheels; current thought is that pinwheels specifically signal *good* memories, innocent and free-blowing relics of childhood. Which has little to do with Kite Kid directly, but all I really have to say about him specifically is that he was was warning sign #1 that I was overleveled.
- <b>Pluto:</b> Obligate flexing joke aside, there's probably something to interrogate here where space and graveyards are concerned. (Pluto links them via [caretaker guy](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/OLD_BEARDY)---who, oh yeah, has some *ominous fucking lines* about the spirits.)
- <b>Earth</b>: Did not fight, RIP.
- <b>Life Jam</b>: I'm still stumped on the bread/life connection. Food is sustenance, and there's an obvious toast pun, but... >8Vc
	- Hmm. Food is sustenance (necessary to live); Orange Oasis, a completely optional vacation area (an escape within an escape), is based on food in all but name. Too much of a good thing.... (Relatedly: Kel's a big eater, much as he rejects milk (which is white, thus relates to White Space, escapism in its emptiest form). No conclusions, only connections.)
	- Anyway tho Kool-Aid Guy™©® Boss Funney.
- <b>Download Window</b>: *Baffling fucking miniboss. I don't know anything.*
	- Didn't get to see it attack, btw. "You are overleveled as all fuck" warning #2...!
- <b>Captain Spaceboy(/Space Ex-Boyfriend)</b>: = Sunny, and maybe = dad (if only because Divorce)? The later hair color change definitely sticks out; pink confirmed for <i class="omo">Omori</i> emo color??
- <b>King Crawler</b>: Appeared out of nowhere! Underrated, arguably underutilized! Definitely *something* to be said about the whole "made of dead sprout moles" thing. ~~Sure hope Sunny didn't see a certain cursed movie, btw.~~
- <b>King Carnivore</b>: Also did not fight. Sad! Uhhh points of note: is also a King, looks like a watermelon, and its "Root" minibosses look *very* similar to Abbi's tentacles.
- <b>Shady Mole, Maximus I--III</b>: *No meta only laffs.* Seriously, I got nothing right now, these guys cracked me up. I love the sprout moles....
- <b>Sweetheart</b>: Mari's perfectionism, But Evil? Weird Freudian attraction shit (considering the Spaceboy fling)?? Becomes a maid (to *Perfectheart,* at that!) later??? IDK.
- <b>Nefarious Chip</b>: *So fucking funny and for <strong class="omo nob">what</strong>.* Also a childhood memory!
	- So I remembered that the origin cookbook came up in the true route (via Kel and Hero's sleepover), and it might in Hikikomori while packing, but more pertinently: *oh, huh, "Papa" changed to "Nefarious."*
- <b>Unbread Twins</b>: Somethig something life/death religious imagery does Basil is jesus, Sunny to Basil is Angel to Mikhael, big question marks everywhere around here and these guys and everything honestly.
	- Playthrough tidbit: They actually posed a *slight* challenge and it was, at that point, a relief!! ...Still not too difficult though lmao, I think the party hit max levels shortly after.
- <b>Jawsum</b>: Dad... 2!! (If Hero:Sunny then Hero's father figure:Sunny's.) Interestingly, he's also the only other character called a "boss," iirc, but far as I've yet unpacked there's *no* connection between the sharkman and either playground-Boss or Basil....
- <b>Roboheart</b>: ZGVzZXJ2ZWQgYmV0dGVy
- <b>Mutantheart/Roboheart</b>: *Who???* Uhh, *also* Mari-connected, which is more obvious with <u>Perfect</u>heart (they even share boss battle backgrounds, though Mari's is Switch-exclusive) than the other two.
- <b>Slime Girls</b>: Mari 3, But Fucked Up??? Uhh, they raise Many Questions and all of them suck. ~~By which I mean it's mostly stuff I can't talk about on GitHub, whoops.~~
- <b>Humphrey</b>: *I fucking hate this guy*---and for reasons that I *also* can't talk about here lmao. Suffice it to say that, although I *know* he's based on a children's book and has notably been corrupted over the iterations, and is linked to Sunny himself, I just!! don't like him!!!!! He sucks!!!!!!!!!!!
	- Omocat has mentioned, on [apparently multiple occasions](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/HUMPHREY_(Location)#TRIVIA), that Humphrey is also *their* least favorite (location, at least) and he could've even been optional. The potential optionality surprises me, honestly, but besides that I feel #vindicated.
- Snaley: *Honestly I just find it funny the Fandom wiki puts him on the boss list.* For all my gripes with that site... +1.

There was other stuff I was going to add here (Sunny/Mari family dynamic speculation) but it was only tangentially related ~~and even less combobulated~~, so on second thought it's getting stashed away for ??later :V
