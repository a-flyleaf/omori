Oh. Hm. This is going to be a novel series by the time it's done, isn't it?

Up until... Vast Forest, I think? which we haven't even reached yet? I was honestly perfectly happy *not* doing a single battle, just exploring and enjoying cutscenes. It was almost disappointing *to* be faced with a battle; like, "aw, interactive story turns into standard JRPG fare :(”

<i class="omo">Omori</i> has an interesting relationship with violence in general, really. It's a standard JRPG aspect, for one, and while I won't claim to be familiar with the genre, I assume there's *usually* some "distance" between the fighting parties; kids aren't punching each other in the face or being assaulted by adult mafia goons, everyone's using pocket monsters! Or, idk, they're teens or young adults with weapons and/or superpowers! Something something no one plays video games for *realistic* violence anyway, I say this like I've ever been in a physical fight of any sort.

Point is, okay, the Headspace kids are fighting *directly*; they have "weapons," we can handwave the rest for suspension of disblief. To a *degree* we can suspend disbelief over having to beat up random sprout moles and bunnies and such, but I sure found it noteworthy just *how damn many* fights give you (or at least gave me) an immediate sense of "no, I don't want to resolve this with violence."

Granted, I really liked <i>Undertale</i>'s "you don't have to fight *anyone*, actually" schtick. It quickly became apparent that does not apply in <i class="omo">Omori</i>-land. I don't really have a thesis here, but "Push & Shove" and "[Tussle Among Trees](https://omori.bandcamp.com/track/tussle-among-trees)" sure have those names for a reason!

Borking the chronology here slightly (this line precedes the battle) but whatever, I also want to draw attention to this particular quote (even though I didn't find it noteworthy while playing until later) so let's thank [the Let's Play](https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2003/) for transcribing so much:

<div class="box"><p>Sprout Moles are highly intelligent creatures, but become dangerously vicious when they are lost.</p></div>

Thanks for saying that with a "^v^" smile, Aubrey.

That's it, that's the thesis, everyone else go home. You're frustrated, you have nowhere to go and no one to turn to, it's just problems and misery and awful closing in from all sides---you're lost. You yell at your brother, falling apart in his face, because he reached out the wrong way. You shove your ex-friend into a lake because he won't *go* away. You grab at something behind your best friend because he can't abandon you, too, why won't he stop struggling? "[You lose all sense](https://lparchive.org/Omori/Update%2075/)."

Kel and Mari are the only ones of the main six who don't lash out once. You can argue Mari did in the prelude to the recital, hell knows how the argument got to *that* point, but then she fucking dies and that overshadows everything. Kel, I think, narratively serves *to be* the one who doesn't drown in his problems, which is necessary for the rest as it is unhealthy for him.

And that's why they're the only two who don't have head rabies, send tweet.

We like character design in this house.

Anyway, other quick observations from around this point:

- In case beating up the first happy sproutmole wasn't needless enough, the second is explicitly stated to be in "fetal position" (thanks, Hero).
- The concept of the "steel chair," in which Weeb makes a joke or otherwise-innocuous-sounding that will later thwack me in the face like the titular furniture, or in which *I* make a comment that Weeb will thwack me in the face with later also, spawns around this point.
- <q class="dc">Also, paraphrasing again but "Wow, Mari's so wonderful, she has everything together so effortlessly!" "Haha I kinda don't :D" "Everyone loves Mari!!!" *all these people have so Issues*</q>
- <q class="dc">Mari just warping her whole picnic save point is obviously a game mechanic but I'm also placing bets on that being somehow ~story-relevant</q>

Basil's house is up next, but before that....

## Theory-Thought the Second: Does Hero is Sunny

<blockquote class="dc" markdown="1">
[seeing the [emotion guide](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/EMOTIONS?file=Emotions_guide.png)]  
<i>The guy everyone loves is associated with Sad, huh</i>

More wild crack theory: Hero as an idealized version of Omori/Sunny? They *look* similar at least, but idk if that's simplified anime sameface
</blockquote>

Okay So Firstly. No, they do not look *terribly* similar, at least not now that I've gotten used to how everyone looks. My best guess as to where the hell I was getting this from was 1. the Rabies Antennae + 2. their eyes are *slightly* less wide than Aubrey and Kel's, comparing the Headspace default portraits.

Second, yes, *obviously* (once you're further along) Hero is A Real Separate Person and not *just* a manifestation of Sunny's imagination. His Headspace incarnation, as with everyone else's, is on shakier ground; I don't think it's helpful to dismiss *all* Headspace characterization just because it's not real, but it should *also* be considered the Headspace crew is everyone *as filtered through Sunny*, particularly Sunny *wish fulfillment*. This will come up again, especially where Aubrey is concerned.... But I digress.

When it comes to Hero/Sunny parallels, I'm looking at this from a writerly "why would a character be made this way?" perspective. Hero, associated with sadness, shut himself in for "[almost a year](https://piped.video/watch?v=JYLbGKHc-DM&t=76)" after Mari's death; Sunny... I mean, the game *exists*, dissociation is his entire schtick. Hero is afraid of spiders---one of Sunny's major phobias. And between the energetic Kel and Aubrey, Hero's chill; even his most emotional [sprites](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/HERO#HEADSPACE) barely even *hint* that he's capable of something that Kel had to block out.

I wouldn't be surprised if there are other parallels I'm missing; admittedly he's not a character I spend a ton of time thinking about. Point is, from what *is* apparent, similarities sure do exist!

Why??

That... I do not have an answer to! I have typed and retyped several thought trains for this, and while it could very well be "this is the third metapost today and I'm not even fully through my first day of playing, holy shit, help" tiredness kicking in, I can't *quite* pin down my reasoning yet. But like, if you're designing characters around the protagonist, "person the protag could be and/or would like to be" isn't a bad bet.

(As for how the rest fit into this oversimplified paradigm: "person the protag needs, spurring change" (Kel); "person who responds to the same situation but different" (Basil); "person who's basically the opposite" (Aubrey). Don't worry, I'm sure they'll all get their turns in the meta-spotlight in due time.)

*Look, there's no reason to emphasize Hero's fear of spiders like that otherwise. There has to be **some** reason his Afraid portraits are grayscale. The parallels are intentional but I cannot pinpoint why, and the closest I can get is "Sunny wants to be (like) Hero."* Also, like, his (nick)name is literally *Hero*, that's as idolized as it gets. Anyway!

## Shoe boy.
Basil living in a shoe is probably a reference to [a fairy tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_was_an_Old_Woman_Who_Lived_in_a_Shoe), but I have no clue why. I don't know why the only *other* time the story draws attention to shoes is in noting that the gang (then the sibling pairs, Sunny+Mari and Hero+Kel) met her when she lost her shoe.

Besides that, I'm not revisiting the parts I skimmed over in-commentary (start of the game, Basil's flower exposition, Ye Olde Sprout Mole) because they're mandatory in any route so I'll get back to them firsthand eventually. It *does* leave this pre-Basil segment feeling a little empty, but ah well.

Have a idle game design note: It very much *felt* like entering Basil's house would be a Point of No Return, since iirc after the cutscene outside (Basil takes a photo, Kel and Aubrey scuffle) you have all the time in the world to linger, backtrack, check all the info Hero's dumped on you (emotion chart, Foe Facts, Self-Help Guide).... Weeb also informed me that the game gave you ample opportunity to go back if you *did* happen to trigger the plot, and said triggers would usually be broadcast clearly; I found this to be mostly true! A+ anti-frustration measures, as someone who likes to scour every possible corner before proceeding!

</blockquote>

Also proof of my gaming genius: I didn't notice the photo placements were highlighted and was guessing the whole time. I apparently guessed *correctly*, which makes me wonder if it's even possible to mess this up. I feel like I should have something more insightful to say about this whole sequence but I spent a majority of it yelling internally and getting jumpscared. Fun times!

This game is *very fucking good* at atmosphere.

<blockquote class="dc"><p>...man don't tell me there's gonna be a part later where there's no choice but to <b style="font-weight:normal;font-family:consolas,monospace;text-transform:uppercase;">stab</b> one of the friends</p></blockquote>

Fun fact about this comment: while definitely being a good little blind-player and not even *glancing* at pictures related to the game, I glimpsed what looked like a screenshot of "<b style="font-weight:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">Stab who?</b>" in the Headspace menu, implying stabbing your friends was in fact something that could happen eventually.

Good thing I was wrong, huh? (Not counting the real-world Aubrey fight; if that'd been *serious* I'd have expected more of a reaction.) The game just bonked me with existential dread of the "imagine being condemned to hell forever because you no longer serve the escapist fantasy in which you exist" sort! Fun and excellent times!!

Bye, Basil. I'm done here tonight. Let's see if I can cover the entire acrophobia segment in less than three posts, yeah?
