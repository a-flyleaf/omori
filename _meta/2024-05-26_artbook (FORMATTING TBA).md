[ARTBOOK](https://archive.org/details/omori-artbook/) OBSERVATIONS
- White Space as... something to log in to? Cutscene of waking up to Mewo.
- Some Omori concepts that I don't remember seeing online anywhere. Neat.
- Mari's sprite page includes those Something portraits in the pink frame. Which is... huh. Pink as a Love Color (I mean, duh; also vaguely anger-associated (pale red); there was another meaning I had ascribed to this iirc but I don't remember off the top of my head....
	- Also on Mari's Headspace sprite page: more piano-playing!
	- On the next: B/W versions of the Headspace talksprites! Huh. I wish there was like, Context to these, but there's *so much art* I can also totally understand just dumping everything as-is. Maybe more words later....
- r/MildlyAmusing to see that there's only one face per Switch-exclusive Boss Rush emotion for everyone; started drawing multiple for Aubrey but apparently decided Nah. Understandable! I've noticed this before from staring at gifs for normal amounts of time and once you see it you can't un-see tbh.
- Categorically do not remember seeing Omori carrying Basil *or* Basil getting into bed, but that could definitely be a "has not gotten that far in Hikikomori yet" skill issue.
- Tiny concept thumbnail of "Sprout Village" (p27) looks a lot like some previews from the Kickstarter era, damn.
- p34, Faraway-Sunny: *Hellooo,* what is that dark sprite wedged between the hospital sprites?
- Very, *very* neat to see how the Switch cover was collaged together. Looks like the scenery uses actual photos that got traced over?
- Basil has an actual *fuckton* of unused sprites, but dataminers have dug that up already.
- *ah wait ok* the interview at the end... yeah someone posted the entirety of this on twitter already :V man, I wish there was more new stuff here but AH WELL.

higher definition versions of [the walkthrough art](https://archive.org/details/omori-walkthrough) are nice tho!
- page 234, canon names for a couple routes from the sleepover onward (and for the record, it calls what I've been calling "hikikomori" the "Neutral Route"): go back to sleep, Shame Route; leave the house, Escape Route. p255: Shame (looking at Basil's body) connects to the Escape Route. Hm, it's implied that you'll only get the Stab Ending if you *do* see Basil's body, and otherwise it'll clip to the Escape? *Much to test out.*
- THANK GOD FOR THAT ROUTE DIAGRAM ON P262
