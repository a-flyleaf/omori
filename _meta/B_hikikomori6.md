it's been a while wtf was I even doing
there will also be few to no screenshots this round probably, but the note-taking must persist. not that I've really looked at previous rounds much but still
- uhh right I think I was doing some sort of "only beat each enemy once" thing, for the sake of not being overleveled... I wanna say I've been everywhere but Cattail so far? and unless Spaceboy proves a *huge* challenge then that it shall be
- ah, the missing Pluto subplot... the "act natural" that isn't natural at all... these kids are such dogshit at lying all of them god bless
- "They can call me what they please, so long as I'm free to do as I please!" and this from the guy associated fairly strongly with Kel. tracks
	- possibly something to poke around here wrt Kel looking up to Pluto and Hero to Pluto's boss (Jawsum)?
	- at any rate, good on Kel for the quick thinking (even if it was simple as "jump in the crater-hole, ft. flowerpot hat for no reason)! boy's fast and that CAN include plan-making, even if it's a simple one-step thing. *Hero's* the one to say "act natural"; of course he's the ~~PR manager~~ social relations guy
- oh yeah, both Kel *and* Aubrey getting teary over Pluto's story sdkfsjdkf, amazing
- absolutely so rude for Kel not to get a good grip on Pluto and for what. boy must have a hell of an arm workout clinging on like that
	- forgot that Pluto straight-up says this. god it's been so LONG
	- the lame Flex music being the same tune that Kel plays on Spaceboy's piano... amazign

SO returning the tape is next, plot-wise, but ngl I mostly just reopened today to go farm more cans for the dog quest. kill some time, enjoy the atmosphere, that good stuff. so until then, ✌️

---ACTUALLY hey for the record, lemme keep track of The Spoils this round:

[item] | <b>can</b> | rubber band | sparkler | life jam | cherry soda | hot dog
---|---
starting tally | <b>16</b> | 15 | 10 | 23 | 23 | 11
The Spoils(sparkle) | <b>can</b> +4 | rubber band +5 | sparkler +8 | life jam +5 | cherry soda +3 | hot dog +5

[mid-hunt idle thoughts]
- wonder why there even *is* a shadow dog... did Kel+Hero's family have one that died when they were super young, before Hector?
	- it's got that angler fish mouth too. huh
- the Sparkler being a Happy item is pretty bittersweet in light of that one calendar art... although hey, "little fires"? like how Aubrey's on fire in the emotion chart despite not having that motif anywhere else? idk food for thought
	- possible counterpoint, the only other prominent fires I can think of... assorted fireplaces (generally warm/relaxed/happy, atmospheric) and uh. Breaven explosion bg. idk it's not emphasized enough to be an Intentional motif I don't think
- remebering belatedly that I think the reason I canned it (har har) on this earlier is because you can't even get the universal remote until later in-game, at which point you've picked up even more trash just from running around and fighting... granted idk if I hit 50 in my first playthrough, in which I beat up basically everything in sight without running ever. idk!
- at any rate this is easily one of the more tedious achie...wait *do* you get an achievement for this?? I forget. oh my god it's been almost a year since I got into this game i am covered in Rust
- listening to [the pokemon Area&nbsp;Zero theme](https://yt.artemislena.eu/watch?v=FuMHCJ_fWJg&listen=1) makes this so much more dramatic/mysterious than it has any right to be btw

*anyway!* took me about 15 minutes to work up to 20 cans. I don't remember if I've used any other items yet but the odds look a lot less skewed this (mini-)round, nice.

- oh, it occurs to me I should see about how tricky Kite Kid is compared to Spaceboy... I took Kite Kid on early in the first playthrough but I was overleveled and all that. hmmm
