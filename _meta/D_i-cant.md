- going back the long way just for shits (as opposed to using pluto) and realizing... wow. Wow. i have not even properly diverged routes yet. I think I was vaguely hoping to collect/compile my Metric Fuckton of Discord Notes but lbr it's scattered across multiple chats and over a year now it's not happening
- oh HELLO apparently I never got Aubrey to learn Headbutt?? WELP
	- <q>Come on! We're best friends!</q> this seemed extremely one-sided at this stage in their lives but points to Kim/Berly for tryings
	- as a side note in the -checks watch- Several Months since I stopped updating my websites and whatnot I've been going ham on RP, and <q>Always with the questions! Can't you just do something without thinking for once!?</q> (along with a later exchange with Kel at Humphrey, where he's like "you worry too much") #hashtagValidates my usual characterization of Aubrey as kind of a... I don't want to say *worrywart* but she's not as calm as she tries to look. And asks about things a lot! Always strikes me during the church scene & even fight that she just keep asking *why* you're here oh wait this whole mini-scene is just gonna give me an excuse to ramble about Favorite Character Characterization isn't it---
- There's a very small square you can move around in before actually doing the headbutting and only Neb and Nose are within it. Also talking to Berly or Van with anyone else tagged gets <q>Hey! I asked for AUBREY! Not you!</q>. love that dev foresight
- <q>Stamina! Stamina!</q> I forget how fucking funny this game is there's literally just a sidequest to learn a powerful skill that involves beating a poor big guy repeatedly for no immediately apparent reason
- WAIT OK I WAS WRONG APPARENTLY this just gives Aubrey +50 juice! (and drains whatever she has!) Berly just... does this. for shits. because she's bored. also aubrey already fuckign knows headbutt can you tell I haven't done this in a while

[immediately gets sidetracked]
