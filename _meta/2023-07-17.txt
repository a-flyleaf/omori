- the prominence of TVs is kind of weird; something something escapism, I might have written about this before but currently Forgor, and while I know the "TV Girl" is a reference to an old character of Omocat's I can't help but squint anyway. there's TVs all over both Faraway and Headspace, most of them don't Do Anything (kept waiting on an achievement for turning them all on, smh), and they definitely *do not* have the visuals on TV Girl's various screens
- not particularly sure what the significance of knife-hacking into traffic cones is either, especially with the mild car motifs (Mom's note to look both ways, possible symbolic implication Mewo got run over (bisected cat))... in his dreams there are no boundaries? seems too easy.
- oh and of course the cones, as with the ?roots back in Vast Forest, fade with the same barlined animation as Omori (or Sunny, in this route), which is A Detail
- moonwalk room is fun, mildly ominous that talking to the Jawsum bar guy in the back silences the music
- got me some bread >:3 gotta say, being underleveled is actually making me use skills. go figure!
	- *I forgot Bread is a healing item also this is the most useful shit ever*
- that frozen lake-place is such a weird little area and I am *very* curious to see how it comes into play later... btw the music uses the same motif as "It Means Everything," have I mentioned that. found it on a youtube comment and my mind has not been at peace since.
- HUH, apparently the ghosts have flavor text! specifically: "SUNHAT GHOST looks around aimlessly as if it is lost." *gee, sorta like a certain two-leafed recurring NPC...*
- "I... I don't know, KEL! I can't really answer that one :D" y'know for someone whose schtick is ~perfection~ Mari admits straight-up to being clueless/Not That Ideal a fairly decent amount, I think? huh. sticks a pin in that, ig.
- forgot about the ghost in the igloo. the fuck is that about
- oh, the bunnies around here don't actually attack you on sight? that's... that's new actually, ~~I don't think any other NPCs do that~~ actually wait the squizzards do. not sure about elsewhere, though ðŸ¤”
- as a side note the follow-ups are so painfully *weaksauce* at this stage, especially Hero's... the Cook is like, unreasonably good in comparison. (NOT COMPLAINING.)
- y'know I'm not really sure what the point of the telescopes is... or ok "what's the point" sounds harsh but like, other than the achievement attached to looking through all of them, and ofc Sunny had a minor space fixation (see: entirety of Otherworld here), but. idk! it's a weird, slow little lookaround thing and I kinda expected here'd be More to it somewhere. maybe in that one snow place...?
- even though Cattail is accessible now I'm gonna skip it since I know we'll be back later... probably being less thorough with exploration in general this run, but I'm still gonna try and nab everything (*especially* once the Hikikomori route diverges proper)
- hm, potentially-symbolically-relevant footnote: the duckrabbit fam lives in a giant gift box, and there's a little cutscene in which Duckie Jr. *gives* you a gift (a Dandelion, which isn't a partiiicularly remarkable object I don't think?). huh
- "Great, now we can spend quality family time together! Now, go to your mom." ok look before anyone gets all finger-pointy "why are you calling the random NPC dad abusive" *this isn't it,* but it seems Notable that most of his dialogue is like.. chiding the kid. and ofc he stands Noticeably Apart from both the kid and mother (visually separated, too, by the rug)---
- OH YEAH the significance of gifts, also, is the violin... the present, Not What You Wanted, causes Anger... *hm.* what a weird little house

anyway! that's a wrap for today, we'll junkyard-scrounge next round... btw the level discrepancy is insane and very much proof that I've actually been needing to like, Strategize
