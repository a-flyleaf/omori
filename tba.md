o heck you found my note-to-self "things to be added eventually" page. nice

## stuff to fix/edit
- oh wait duh, on the art pages: just have thumbnails for current/next/prev? idk I just think the long box looks Worse with multiple rows, it feels too "more like this"-y and if people wanna see Everything that's what the art index is for
	- have the index use pixel thumbnails on mobile/by default too
- gif image sizing isn't ideal at suboptimal screenwidths, thiiink a background-size attribute should fix that
	- don't forget to check the index+Mewo

## main content
- the actual... liveblog-revisitening... that the site was made to house....
- and allllll the other notes I've hoarded along the way. somehow

## other pages
linked on the index via mini door, draw a new one
- guide to ripping the sprites/music + what the folders/files actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- version for me, as of first playthrough
	- for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically idetical but not markdown-specific
- CDs!! they're not in the official OST. could be extended to other not-OST track videos, like slowed versions in Black Space 2?
	- bonus points for an HTML table that kinda mirrors the Black Space refthing, aligned right and everything
	- the LP has some of these non-OST tracks, or at least the Black Space clock one and *presumably* others
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something. the omori page can be a hub for all this
	- "a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/omori"... mewo (mewo). omori (omori). vri
- ``/headspace-faraway``. Just a standalone doodle for now.
	- or maybe I'll end up smushing this together with the OTHER au idea lol help

### done
linked somewhere, but nowhere specific
- [Black Space area ref](black-space)
- [OMORI ALTER](art/omori-alter), if I end up with multiple art-offshoot pages)
- [Heardle](heardle)
