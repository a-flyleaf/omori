o heck you found my note-to-self "things to be added eventually" page. nice

## stuff to fix/edit
- oh wait duh, on the art pages: just have thumbnails for current/next/prev? idk I just think the long box looks Worse with multiple rows, it feels too "more like this"-y and if people wanna see Everything that's what the art index is for
	- ~~have the index use pixel thumbnails on mobile/by default too~~ DONE but keeping this as a reminder for a potential revamp... idk maybe the next version will have only highlights (with little descriptions!) on the index, then a thumbnail wall
- gif image sizing isn't ideal at suboptimal screenwidths, thiiink a background-size attribute should fix that
	- don't forget to check the index+Mewo
- uhh. specific favicons maybe? don't have to go the full 9 yards with the generator but just for particular pages (thinking an inverted one for black-space, mari+omori; flag stripes on hrvatski; murdergaem would be funny as fuck with dot-eyed sunny from the stranger one)
	- try `if layout.favicon==true or page.favicon==true`?

## other pages
linked on the index via ~~mini door, draw a new one~~ oh what if it's a key actually
- guide to ripping the sprites/music + what the folders/files actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
	- +absolutely blursed comment for the filerip page: “[x] is that one picture of everyone’s (least?) favorite donut, in case you wanted Sweetheart’s hole in high definition for whatever reason.”  
	thought of THAT out of nowhere and i hate it, i Must inflict it upon the world
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- ~~version for me, as of first playthrough~~
	- ~~for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically identical but not markdown-specific~~
	- **[WIP](achievements)**, but keeping this here until it's actually done
- CDs!! they're not in the official OST. could be extended to other not-OST track videos, like slowed versions in Black Space 2?
	- bonus points for an HTML table that kinda mirrors the Black Space refthing, aligned right and everything
	- the LP has some of these non-OST tracks, or at least the Black Space clock one and *presumably* others
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something.
	- ~~omori~~, sunny?, kel, hero, aubrey, basil, ~~mari~~, something

### /doors (and art thing)
linked somewhere, but nowhere specific
- [Black Space area ref]({%include url.html%}/black-space)
- [OMORI ALTER]({%include url.html%}/art/omori-alter), if I end up with multiple art-offshoot pages
	- ok well. there's [murdergaem]({%include url.html%}/murdergaem) now ig. and maaaaybe the hrvatski comics idek, i feel like those don't really need standalone pages but it's nice to have a single-image version for smoother reading
- [Heardle]({%include url.html%}/heardle)
- [Hrvatski saga]({%include url.html%}/hrvatski)
- [Mari.]({%include url.html%}/mari)
- [piano~]({%include url.html%}/piano)
- [Omori (Omori)]({%include url.html%}/omori)
- [achievements]({%include url.html%}/achievements)
