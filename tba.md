o heck you found my note-to-self "things to be added eventually" page. nice

## stuff to fix/edit
- oh wait duh, on the art pages: just have thumbnails for current/next/prev? idk I just think the long box looks Worse with multiple rows, it feels too "more like this"-y and if people wanna see Everything that's what the art index is for
	- have the index use pixel thumbnails on mobile/by default too
- gif image sizing isn't ideal at suboptimal screenwidths, thiiink a background-size attribute should fix that
	- don't forget to check the index+Mewo
- ~~automate the custom css on meta pages, somehow... does this Have to have a convoluted if/unless tree~~ lol no fuck it revamp the whole meta thing, see below:

## meta overhaul
[3/24] ok uh. thinking about the omori meta thing and: fuck it, leave the series as-is, but just,, Move On. publish the draft more or less as it exists, with an addendum noting its intentional incompletion, and then a postscript simply titled “um.” and up top is a doodle of aubrey with too many fucking phones. hold on actually lemme type a draft—

<div markdown="1" style="border:1px solid #bfbfbf; padding:0 1em;">
I have reached a bit of an impasse.

So like, this big liveblog-liveblog was kind of originally the entire reason I wanted to make this site. Then it became the last thing I actually added. And after effectively speedrunning the first three posts, then setting it aside for A While, over time I have realized that I… do not actually want to do this.

Or like. I *do*. I have So Mnay Fuckign Thoughts, a lot of the big ideas were developed throughout the playthrough and I don’t *not* enjoy revisiting it all. But it’s also, just… A Lot Of Recycling. It is extremely possible to skim moar and condense entire days into bullet points, but then I feel like I’m doing neither observations nor the game itself *justice*; the perfect is the enemy of the good and all, but my “summaries” almost always turn into extended rambles anyway.

Also, like, the time I spend writing Meta Novels could also be spent… experiencing the rest of the game (hi, Hikikomori!). making Newer (still-OMORI-related) Things, like this one angsty-ass AU that I keep chewing on where Basil and Sunny die and Kel and Aubrey have to deal with that and it goes about as well (awful as all fuck) as anyone might expect but *it’s not a suicide domino like every other YouTube comment is convinced it would be dammit* (but it’s still going to suck a lot of shit for a very long time). Or this other, still-fucked-up-but-less-overtly-angsty AU where, after a certain other ending, Headspace still exists but is… *different*, and I swear I *need* firsthand Hikikomori knowledge to develop it properly because it has the deeply-buried shit surfacing nearly from the getgo and it’s all experimental and wack and at *some point* there’s the line “You loved them and you left them.” (Guess the ending that fucks me up most!!)

Wow, I swear I write more than buckets of angst. I want them to be happy but I also need to dunk them in giant fucking angst buckets first okay?? okay. ah fuck it this isn’t a draft I’m just rambling HERE’S THE POINTS THO:
- still Want to compile thoughts but this Properly-Written Blog Post thing is overwhelming me already
- pile of thoughts also increases exponentially forever
- in the mean time I could actually be playing the rest of the game, and/or making new stuff, instead of Recycling Forever
- so I think i will Do That
- and inevitably ~thoughts~ will keep coming up along the way
- and *eventually* maybe I will put together Real Proper Blog Post Series to detail the Main Theories but today is not that day
- also I read a book where the author kept fucking saying “we’ll get to this later” and it drove me nuts, idk why I thought it was a good idea to write in so haphazardly
- +feel free to tease the AU shit too why not. it ain’t the Focus but they sure are recurring thoughts I may or may not ever do anything with someday
</div>

## other pages
linked on the index via ~~mini door, draw a new one~~ oh what if it's a key actually
- guide to ripping the sprites/music + what the folders/files actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
	- +absolutely blursed comment for the filerip page: “[x] is that one picture of everyone’s (least?) favorite donut, in case you wanted Sweetheart’s hole in high definition for whatever reason.”  
	thought of THAT out of nowhere and i hate it, i Must inflict it upon the world
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- version for me, as of first playthrough
	- for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically identical but not markdown-specific
- CDs!! they're not in the official OST. could be extended to other not-OST track videos, like slowed versions in Black Space 2?
	- bonus points for an HTML table that kinda mirrors the Black Space refthing, aligned right and everything
	- the LP has some of these non-OST tracks, or at least the Black Space clock one and *presumably* others
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something.
	- ~~omori~~, sunny?, kel, hero, aubrey, basil, ~~mari~~, something
- ``/headspace-faraway``. Just a standalone doodle for now.
	- or maybe I'll end up smushing this together with the OTHER au idea lol help
