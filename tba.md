## other pages (mini door, draw a new one)
- [Black Space.](black-space)
	- i. somehow did not not notice bandcamp has an embed functionality. yooooo (can be used on the CD page (see below) too)
- guide to ripping the sprites + what the folders actually are
	- optional commentary for the latter (compiled from the txt note); either separate pages or use details
	- you can get music too btw
- achievement checklist, noting which route (both, true, hikikomori) & simplest how-to (story checkpoint, do xyz)
	- version for me, as of first playthrough
	- for ease of copying, two versions in a textarea: one with markdown formatting (checklist via ``[ ]``, ``###`` h3 headers) and one that's basically idetical but not markdown-specific
- CDs!! they're not in the official OST. could be extended to other not-OST track videos, like slowed versions in Black Space 2?
	- bonus points for an HTML table that kinda mirrors the Black Space refthing, aligned right and everything
- what's a 90s-style indie site without random one-off pages. like, you type in "[url]/kel" and get a SLAM DUNK gif or something. the omori page can be a hub for all this
	- "a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/omori"... mewo (mewo). omori (omori). vri
- [Heardle](https://omori-heardle-2-5.glitch.me/), because I keep doing it
- the art/omori-alter page isn't Much but maaaaybe it can be linked from the hub here? or maybe only do that if I end up having multiple art-offshoot pages
- ``/headspace-faraway``. Just a standalone doodle for now.

## MEWO (Mewo)
- Waiting for something to happen? \[details no summary, use the CSS open selector to change the gif]
- maybe link the idea dump? "something" should definitely be clickable as a bonus, maaaaybe the question mark too but idk where to

(we've saving the homepage for last apparently)
