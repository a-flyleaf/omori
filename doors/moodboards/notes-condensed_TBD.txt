## original notes 7/30
- MARI has the fuckin,, aesthetic edits, 3x3 grid. there’s a piano and the flowers and a softball bat but also bugs and sunsets and a cat, some meme shit, maybe random sadako jumpscare.
- kel’s looks like a shitpost and/or like it was assembled in mspaint, not because he’s doing it on purpose but because He Is Kel. he kinda just went on a generic image search and so his has like, stock photos badly stretched and taken straight from the result thumbnail. very orange and very Him. (earnest, in other words.)
- hero… man ok i’m thinking he’s like, Trying to make one like mari (aestheticy, coherent) but he takes it very seriously and also doesn’t really know what he’s doing, and he’s *trying* to have fun with it too (ok ftr i’m not saying everyone *made* their own moodboard but i’m just conveying the mood) but it’s like. idk it’s unsplash (pre-edited!) with some stock photos. he’s trying his best, i think.

### addendum-notes
- Mari: fills out that 9x9, OR a vertical with 1x2/2x1 on either side (flipped) and 3 down the middle
- Hero: also 9x9?
- Kel: ignores the grid, basically. there’s an attempt at a central composition tho
- stickers/non-grid add-ons are allowed, as is filling in the bg. the grid is probably visible on kel’s and mspaint-bucket’d in orange

+[8/19] honestly kel's should be a jpeg. fuck this fancy code nonsense
