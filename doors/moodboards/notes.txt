## original notes 7/30
- sunny: it’s like, 3 pictures. subject on a white bg. not heavily edited, maybe “waiting for something to happen”?; the pictures chosen don’t need much editing anyway. very white space-esque.
- MARI has the fuckin,, aesthetic edits, 3x3 grid. there’s a piano and the flowers and a softball bat but also bugs and sunsets and a cat, some meme shit, maybe random sadako jumpscare.
- kel’s looks like a shitpost and/or like it was assembled in mspaint, not because he’s doing it on purpose but because He Is Kel. he kinda just went on a generic image search and so his has like, stock photos badly stretched and taken straight from the result thumbnail. very orange and very Him. (earnest, in other words.)
- aubrey… ok see my first thought was that *hers* was all aestheticy but like her color scheme is bright as fuck, so there’s cute things and church shit but also bright overlays, pops of neon. cmyk-core maybe. moody quote somewhere but it’s not monopolizing the canvas by any means
- hero… man ok i’m thinking he’s like, Trying to make one like mari (aestheticy, coherent) but he takes it very seriously and also doesn’t really know what he’s doing, and he’s *trying* to have fun with it too (ok ftr i’m not saying everyone *made* their own moodboard but i’m just conveying the mood) but it’s like. idk it’s unsplash (pre-edited!) with some stock photos. he’s trying his best, i think.
- basil—BASIL is the aesthetic motherfucker and he has two entirely separate v—no wait that’s basil to sunny. no, no, basil *directly* mixes the depression with the sunflowers, it’s *very* intentionally juxtaposed; includes his own line about looking to the sun but there’s also like, depression/anxietycore. it’s probably the most Moodboard:tm: of all these, even beating mari’s just because she includes aesthetically-edited shitposts and the tonal whiplash is less Planned

### addendum-notes
- 3x3 grid, same margin, for all of them. need not be 9 pictures tho
- Sunny: quote in the middle (horizontal 3) with small squares above+below ; the rest is intententionally blank
- Mari: fills out that 9x9, OR a vertical with 1x2/2x1 on either side (flipped) and 3 down the middle
- Hero: also 9x9?
- Kel: ignores the grid, basically. there’s an attempt at a central composition tho
- Aubrey/Basil: not sure, thinking maybe 2x1/1x2 horizontally. Basil prooobably has more than her tho
- stickers/non-grid add-ons are allowed, as is filling in the bg. the grid is probably visible on kel’s and mspaint-bucket’d in orange

+[8/19] honestly kel's should be a jpeg. fuck this fancy code nonsense

## image-scrounging 8/19
snuuy (or omori, sunny gets a "mirrored" version with more pictures + the broken lightbulb on the bottom center?)
