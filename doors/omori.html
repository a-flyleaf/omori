	<p class="wtf pad">I still think his character arc is an allegory for the fall of man.</p>
	<div class="pad wh">
	<p>Think about it - the protagonist of everything is haunted by Basil (inability to repent) and betrayed Mari (female) and Basil also (the LGBT community) in order to suck up to a devious murderbeast (himself), who gets irrationally over his fear of spiders (Something), a dark web of unholy lies which he does not truly know or understand because its actions directly contradict his happier ideals and goals.</p>

	<p id="mid">Sunny must also confront Aubrey (the increasingly dispossessed and disillusioned exiles from Eden) and <a href="https://beforeireadhomestuck.tumblr.com/post/122010041909/before-i-read-homestuck-i-thought-that-vriska-was#posts">Omori (Omori)</a> with the intention of attacking them as well, while his past self has made futile attempts at flirting with Kel (true escapism).</p>

	<p>It just makes too much sense.</p>
