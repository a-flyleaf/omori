I am in deep and irrevocable love with piano arrangements of non-piano music---and especially arrangements like [this version of the <i>Professor&nbsp;Layton</i> "Puzzles" theme](https://piped.video/watch?v=Mf0z-IWbg7o), which are so much more than a note-to-note transcription. And while I'm no composer, I've been playing piano since I was 11, and wanted to mess around with an <i class="omo">Omori</i> song or two---so, here we are!

(This page is quick â€™n' bare bones for now, I'll pretty it up when I make a better video for *real* publication....)

- arrangement: [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/5471401/scores/10616545) + [video](https://musescore.com/user/5471401/scores/10616545) (meh quality, need to retake) + [PDF]({%include url.html%}/assets/h20.pdf)

v1, February--April 2023. Thought this song and "[Spaces In-between](https://omori.bandcamp.com/track/spaces-in-between)" might be in the same key, played around to confirm, and it took off from there. First time actually finishing & publishing a piano arrangement \o/ It's a bit rough, especially where the White&nbsp;Space motif comes in, and the left hand could have more variation, but overall Iâ€™m pretty satisfied with it!

Intentionally lacks legato, pedal, and most dynamic markings because I ~~didn't feel like wrangling MuseScore more than I already had~~ figure those can be left to the player. Personally, I play it with lots of legato, gratuitous sustain, and overall mid-soft except where noted. That impossible chord at the end just needs descending notes; I like to slow down to the very end.

Fun fact: I wanted to incorporate pieces from <i>[Pavane pour une infante dÃ©funte](https://piped.video/watch?v=phGnV7BBxxQ)</i>, especially the part in a similar key (1:14 in the linked video), but my "process" (transcribe the left&nbsp;hand, then the melody, then mess around with other notes for ~flourish~) didn't leave much room for major improvisations. Mostly putting this here as a self-reminder, if I ever revisit the composition.... >:Vc
