also naturally there can should and Must be bonus pages, which could be accessed through the door. *what* bonuses idek, maybe one’s a straight-up sitemap, but The Potential Is There. (would also be fun to make other little fansites like this for past interests (ena, ddlc) but that’s getting WAY too ahead of myself)

oh, oh, other potential pages:
- asset rip folder guide (one plain, one with extra commentary drawing loosely from the txt note)
- achievement guide (checklist with wiki links, plus a version for me as of current). notes which route (both, true, hikikomori) & the simplest version of how (story checkpoint, other). for ease of copying, a textarea with two versions—one with markdown formatting (so [ ] at the start of each & ###h3 headers), and one that’s basically identical but without the () and ###

ALSO link the lparchive in fansources!! the player’s made some presentation decisions that I Do Not Like (giving “talksprites” to characters without, including spirit!Mari; inserting dialogue in the Omori fight which is *not* there in-game, without making clear this is their own insert; assorted punctuation nitpicks; and I’m fairly certain I’ve caught things they missed but don’t remember off the top of my head… maybe like, sprite movements in cutscenes?)—HOWEVER, it’s still a more or less faithful transcription from what I’ve seen, without *significant* commentary that might mess with impressions, so it’s a decent way to recheck conversation scripts. also unlike the data dump it’s in context, and unlike a video :sparkle:it’s skimmable:sparkle:
