ok. hype of thetically. omori fansite, and make it look 90s. would look at home on neocities but use github anyway for ease of updates
splash optional, homepage looks like white space (with doodles in place of sprites, as not to use official material)
- LINKS (lightbulb?)
— official: website, bandcamp, social media (both the game & devs)
— fanmade resources: fandom wiki, goats.dev data dump, that one neocities site that mirrors the omoriboy posts
— me: github site, dA
— maybe?: fanart and/or fic recs that live in my head rent free (could be a separate page maybe, meta included; hell even a tumblr to dissuade link rot), that one site that lets you rip all the files (not directly omori-related But Like.)
- BLOG (laptop)
— “Today I thought about OMORI.” < that’s it that’s the header, but actual content is more like an update/changelog. changelog more than anything actually, not full blog posts
- ART (sketchbook)
— obligate shameless fanart dumping
- Mewo & Omori are There; details? Mewo: “Waiting for something to happen?” and Omori just sits down (use the CSS open selector)
- no hand-forks, those can be a design element maybe (lists might be too busy but maybe like, section headers or general Important indicators)
- oh and the tissue box. idek, uh. credits?? eventually this could be a Batshit Freud Theory portal lmao

also naturally there can should and Must be bonus pages, which could be accessed through the door. *what* bonuses idek, maybe one’s a straight-up sitemap, but The Potential Is There. (would also be fun to make other little fansites like this for past interests (ena, ddlc) but that’s getting WAY too ahead of myself)
edit: WAIT NO ok: Mewo in the footer (with the dialogue bonus, but mostly as a visual mark at the end of the page), keep this simple for now, and the door’s on the *splash* page (click to enter). bonus stuff can be hands.

[20:18] having actually coded part of the site, ohhhh: hand in the footer *as a return to the index*, which will be especially necessary on offshoots like the Black Space wall. (for the index itself, it links to the splash page!)
